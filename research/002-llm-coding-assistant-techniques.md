# Enhancing LLM-Based Coding Assistants: Techniques and Applications in Elixir

This document explores the most effective techniques used today in real-world LLM-assisted code generation systems, compares their effectiveness, and suggests how these ideas can be applied using the Elixir programming language and BEAM ecosystem.

## Overview of Key Techniques

| Technique                     | Description | Reported Gains |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Chain-of-Thought (CoT)       | Prompts LLMs to reason step-by-step. | +13.8% pass@1 (Structured CoT) |
| Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | Supplies relevant code/docs as extra context. | +3x improvement in pass@1 |
| Iterative Self-Correction    | LLM revises output after test or error feedback. | From 53.8% to 81.8% accuracy |
| Agentic Workflows            | Multi-step planning with tools, memory, actions. | +2–20% across tasks |

## 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps LLMs plan their steps. A “structured” CoT approach asks the model to list helper functions or outline the logic before code generation. For example:

```elixir
"Let's think step-by-step. First, what helper functions do we need? Then, write each before the main function."
```

Reported impact:
- Structured CoT improved pass@1 by 13.8% over standard CoT.
- Helps break complex coding into smaller logical units.

---

## 2. Retrieval and Indexing (RAG)

Instead of relying solely on prompt memory, tools can query a code/document index to retrieve useful context before generation. This can include:

- Module documentation
- Related functions
- Usage patterns

Reported impact:
- EvoR framework improved pass@1 from 8.6% to 35.3%.
- ARCS showed higher correctness and faster convergence.

Elixir Implementation:
- Use `pgvector` + Ash or Ecto for vector search.
- Embed code/docs with OpenAI, Mistral, or local model.
- Store vectors in PostgreSQL for retrieval.

---

## 3. Iterative Self-Correction

LLMs generate code → run tests → use results to improve. These agents might:

- Run unit tests and re-prompt on failure.
- Lint code and summarize issues for the LLM.
- Use error messages in prompt refinement.

Reported impact:
- 53.8% → 81.8% correctness with test/review cycle.
- RethinkMCTS used test-guided search to go from 70% → 89%.

Elixir Implementation:
- Use Oban jobs for test execution.
- Stream test results to agent via PubSub.
- Prompt engine retries generation with feedback.

---

## 4. Agentic Multi-Step Workflows

Agents combine LLMs, tool use, memory, and planning. Examples:
- Tool use: run, test, search
- Memory: short/long-term recall
- Planning: outline → code → test → fix

Frameworks like DSPy, LangChain, and smol-agents support this.

Elixir Implementation:
- Use GenServers for agent tools.
- Use Reactor for DAG logic.
- Spark DSL to define agent plans.
- LangChain (Elixir) for LLM calls.

## 5. Open-Source Tools: Aider & OpenCode

### Aider
- GPT-powered CLI code assistant.
- Git integration, test auto-run, context-aware.
- Supports Claude, GPT, local models.

### OpenCode
- TUI with multi-model support.
- Works offline or with API LLMs.
- Agent-driven code editing via terminal.

## 6. BEAM-Friendly Considerations

Elixir is ideal for:
- Supervising multi-agent trees (OTP)
- Streaming context/results (Phoenix PubSub)
- Fault-tolerant memory + background jobs (Oban, GenServer)

Tools to build with:
- LangChain Elixir (LLM adapters)
- Ash Framework (agent modules)
- pgvector (memory storage)
- Phoenix Channels (client comms)

## Summary of Effectiveness

| Technique                  | Example Tool     | Impact                            |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Chain-of-Thought          | DSPy             | +13.8% pass@1                     |
| RAG                       | EvoR, ARCS       | 3–4x improvement in correctness   |
| Iterative Correction      | CodeAgent        | +28% accuracy                     |
| Agentic Planning          | smol-agents, Aider | +5–20% on multi-step tasks       |

These techniques combine to form powerful assistants that reason, retrieve, refine, and remember.
