# LiveView telemetry dashboard implementation patterns

Phoenix LiveView provides a powerful foundation for building real-time telemetry dashboards with minimal JavaScript. This comprehensive guide covers implementation patterns, visualization strategies, and performance optimizations based on current best practices and production-proven approaches.

## Best practices for real-time metric dashboards

LiveView's server-side state management and automatic change tracking enable efficient real-time dashboards. The framework's built-in optimizations handle WebSocket connections and DOM updates automatically, making it ideal for telemetry visualization.

**Core architecture principles** include separating business logic from LiveView callbacks, using temporary assigns for ephemeral data, and leveraging LiveComponents for stateful UI sections. Never pass socket structs to business logic functionsâ€”only extract necessary data from `socket.assigns`. This separation ensures testability and maintains clear boundaries between presentation and domain logic.

For **high-frequency metric updates**, implement server-side debouncing using scheduled updates rather than broadcasting every telemetry event. The pattern involves collecting metrics in a buffer and sending batch updates at regular intervals:

```elixir
def handle_info(:update_metrics, socket) do
  schedule_metrics_update()
  metrics = fetch_latest_metrics()
  {:noreply, assign(socket, metrics: metrics)}
end

defp schedule_metrics_update do
  Process.send_after(self(), :update_metrics, 1000)
end
```

**Memory optimization** requires careful management of socket assigns. Store only data required for rendering, use temporary assigns for large datasets that change frequently, and leverage LiveView streams for collections. The streams API efficiently manages client-side data without server memory overhead, making it perfect for log displays or time-series data visualization.

## Telemetry visualization patterns in Elixir

Elixir's telemetry ecosystem centers around the `:telemetry` library, providing standardized event emission and handling. Phoenix applications include built-in telemetry instrumentation, creating a comprehensive observability foundation through Telemetry.Metrics.

**Organizing metrics** follows a hierarchical pattern with system metrics (VM memory, process queues), business metrics (request counts, user interactions), and custom domain-specific measurements. The standard approach uses Telemetry.Metrics to define five core metric types:

```elixir
def metrics do
  [
    # Counter for total events
    counter("http.request.count", tags: [:method, :status]),
    
    # Summary with statistics
    summary("phoenix.endpoint.stop.duration", 
            unit: {:native, :millisecond}),
    
    # Last value for current state
    last_value("vm.memory.total", unit: {:byte, :kilobyte}),
    
    # Distribution with buckets
    distribution("http.request.duration", 
                 buckets: [100, 300, 500, 1000])
  ]
end
```

**Time-series visualization** benefits from specialized storage like TimescaleDB for PostgreSQL users or standard PostgreSQL with proper indexing for smaller datasets. The data pipeline flows from telemetry events through metrics aggregation to time-series optimized storage, finally reaching real-time charts via LiveView components.

## Chart library integration strategies

LiveView supports both server-side SVG rendering and JavaScript chart libraries through hooks. Each approach offers distinct advantages for different use cases.

**Contex**, the native Elixir charting library, provides pure server-side rendering with perfect LiveView integration. Charts update in real-time with minimal overhead and support interactive elements through `phx-click` handlers. While limited in chart types compared to JavaScript alternatives, Contex excels for simple visualizations that benefit from server-side state management.

**JavaScript libraries** like Chart.js, ApexCharts, and ECharts integrate through LiveView hooks. Chart.js offers the best balance of features and performance for most dashboards. The integration pattern uses hooks for initialization and `handleEvent` for updates:

```javascript
export default {
  mounted() {
    const config = JSON.parse(this.el.dataset.config);
    this.chart = new Chart(this.el, config);
    
    this.handleEvent("update-chart", ({data}) => {
      this.chart.data.datasets[0].data = data;
      this.chart.update('none'); // Skip animations
    });
  }
}
```

For **complex visualizations**, D3.js provides ultimate flexibility but requires more JavaScript expertise. VegaLite offers a middle ground with declarative specifications that work well with LiveView's server-driven architecture.

## Efficient data structures for telemetry storage

ETS tables provide the most efficient in-memory storage for telemetry data with constant-time access and built-in concurrency support. The recommended pattern uses ETS for hot data and delegates historical storage to time-series databases:

```elixir
defmodule TelemetryStorage do
  def init_storage do
    :ets.new(:telemetry_metrics, [
      :set, :public, :named_table,
      {:read_concurrency, true},
      {:write_concurrency, true}
    ])
  end
  
  def store_metric(key, value, timestamp) do
    :ets.insert(:telemetry_metrics, {key, value, timestamp})
  end
end
```

**Circular buffers** bound memory usage for historical data while maintaining recent telemetry information. Libraries like CircularBuffer provide efficient implementations that integrate cleanly with GenServer-based metric collectors.

For **socket assigns optimization**, minimize stored data by filtering to visible items and using temporary assigns for ephemeral metrics. LiveView streams handle large, frequently updated datasets efficiently:

```elixir
def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
  {:ok, stream(socket, :metrics, [])}
end

def handle_info({:new_metrics, metrics}, socket) do
  {:noreply, stream_insert(socket, :metrics, metrics)}
end
```

**Update patterns** leverage Phoenix.PubSub for broadcasting metric updates to multiple dashboard instances. Implement throttling for high-frequency updates to prevent overwhelming clients:

```elixir
def handle_cast({:update, data}, state) do
  now = System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)
  
  if now - state.last_broadcast > 1000 do
    broadcast_update(data)
    {:noreply, %{state | last_broadcast: now}}
  else
    Process.send_after(self(), :flush_pending, 1000)
    {:noreply, %{state | pending_data: data}}
  end
end
```

## Configurable metric display patterns

Configuration flexibility requires a layered approach with global system-wide defaults, role-based configurations, and user-specific preferences. Runtime configuration avoids compile-time coupling:

```elixir
config :my_app, :dashboard,
  default_metrics: [
    %{
      name: "http_requests",
      event: [:phoenix, :endpoint, :stop],
      measurement: :duration,
      visible: true,
      category: "web",
      required_roles: []
    }
  ]
```

**User preferences** can be stored in databases for persistence or ETS tables for session-based storage. The configuration resolution pattern merges defaults with user preferences:

```elixir
def resolve_visible_metrics(user_id) do
  defaults = get_metrics_config()
  user_prefs = get_user_preferences(user_id)
  
  Enum.map(defaults, fn metric ->
    visible = Map.get(user_prefs, metric.name, metric.visible)
    %{metric | visible: visible}
  end)
end
```

**Widget-based architectures** enable drag-and-drop dashboard customization. Each widget is a LiveComponent managing its own state and configuration:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Dashboard.WidgetComponent do
  use Phoenix.LiveComponent
  
  def render(assigns) do
    ~H"""
    <div class="widget" data-widget-id={@widget.id}>
      <div class="widget-header">
        <h3><%= @widget.title %></h3>
        <button phx-click="toggle_widget" 
                phx-value-widget-id={@widget.id}>
          <%= if @widget.visible, do: "Hide", else: "Show" %>
        </button>
      </div>
      <%= render_widget_content(assigns) %>
    </div>
    """
  end
end
```

## Production-ready implementation patterns

A complete telemetry system architecture combines storage, aggregation, broadcasting, and visualization layers. The supervisor tree ensures resilience:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.TelemetrySystem do
  use Supervisor
  
  def init(_opts) do
    children = [
      {MyApp.TelemetryStorage, []},
      {MyApp.MetricAggregator, []},
      {MyApp.TelemetryHistory, buffer_size: 10_000},
      {TelemetryMetricsPrometheus, metrics: metrics()},
      {MyApp.TelemetryBroadcaster, []}
    ]
    
    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

**Security considerations** include implementing proper authentication pipelines, role-based access control for sensitive metrics, and validated metric configuration imports. Never expose system metrics without authentication.

**Performance monitoring** uses LiveView's built-in telemetry events to track dashboard performance itself. Monitor mount duration, render times, and WebSocket payload sizes to ensure optimal user experience.

The combination of LiveView's server-side state management, Elixir's telemetry ecosystem, and careful architectural choices enables building sophisticated real-time dashboards that scale efficiently while remaining maintainable. Start with native Elixir solutions like Contex for simple visualizations, add JavaScript libraries when advanced features are needed, and always prioritize user experience through thoughtful performance optimization and configuration flexibility.
