# WebSocket CLI Client Feature Summary

## Overview

This feature transforms the RubberDuck CLI from a mix task-based implementation to a standalone WebSocket client that communicates with the running Phoenix server. This eliminates the need for recompilation on each command and preserves server state between CLI invocations.

## Problem Statement

The original CLI implementation used mix tasks which had several limitations:
- Required full project compilation for each command
- Lost server state between commands
- Slow startup time
- Could not leverage real-time features
- Limited to local execution

## Solution

Created a standalone CLI client that:
1. Connects to the Phoenix server via WebSocket channels
2. Maintains persistent connection for multiple commands
3. Supports streaming responses for long-running operations
4. Uses API key authentication for security
5. Builds as a distributable escript binary

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Components

1. **Server-side Components**:
   - `CLIChannel` - Phoenix channel handling all CLI commands
   - Enhanced `UserSocket` with API key authentication
   - `Mix.Tasks.RubberDuck.Auth` for API key management

2. **Client-side Components**:
   - `CLIClient.Client` - WebSocket client using Phoenix.Channels.GenSocketClient
   - `CLIClient.Transport` - Transport layer for WebSocket communication
   - `CLIClient.Auth` - API key storage and management
   - `CLIClient.Main` - Escript entry point with Optimus CLI parsing
   - `CLIClient.Formatter` - Output formatting (JSON, plain, table)
   - Command handlers for each CLI operation

### Key Features Implemented

1. **WebSocket Communication**:
   - Persistent connection to server
   - Automatic reconnection on disconnect
   - Real-time bidirectional communication

2. **Authentication System**:
   - API key generation on server
   - Secure storage in `~/.rubber_duck/config.json`
   - Token-based WebSocket authentication

3. **Command Support**:
   - All existing CLI commands (analyze, generate, complete, refactor, test, llm)
   - Streaming support for long-running operations
   - Progress indicators and real-time updates

4. **Build System**:
   - Escript configuration for standalone binary
   - Embedded Elixir runtime
   - No external dependencies required

### Technical Decisions

1. **Phoenix.Channels.GenSocketClient**: Chosen for robust WebSocket client implementation with automatic reconnection

2. **API Key Authentication**: Simple, secure method for CLI authentication without complex OAuth flows

3. **Escript Packaging**: Creates truly standalone binary that can be distributed without Elixir installation

4. **Channel-based Architecture**: Leverages Phoenix's real-time capabilities for efficient communication

## Benefits

1. **Performance**:
   - No compilation overhead
   - Instant command execution after initial connection
   - Efficient binary protocol over WebSocket

2. **User Experience**:
   - Faster response times
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Consistent server state

3. **Deployment**:
   - Single binary distribution
   - Works with remote servers
   - Easy installation process

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Clear separation between CLI and server
   - Testable channel interface
   - Modular command structure

## Usage Examples

```bash
# One-time setup
./bin/rubber_duck auth setup

# Fast command execution (no compilation)
./bin/rubber_duck analyze lib/my_module.ex
./bin/rubber_duck generate "Create a GenServer"
./bin/rubber_duck llm connect ollama

# Streaming operations
./bin/rubber_duck generate "Complex implementation" --verbose
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Server Support**: Connect to different RubberDuck instances
2. **Command History**: Store and replay previous commands
3. **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple commands in sequence
4. **Plugin System**: Extend CLI with custom commands
5. **GUI Client**: Build graphical interface using same WebSocket protocol

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `/lib/rubber_duck_web/channels/cli_channel.ex` - Main channel handler
- `/lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/` - Complete CLI client implementation
- `/lib/mix/tasks/rubber_duck.auth.ex` - API key management
- `/test/rubber_duck_web/channels/cli_channel_test.exs` - Channel tests

### Modified:
- `/mix.exs` - Added dependencies and escript configuration
- `/lib/rubber_duck_web/channels/user_socket.ex` - Added CLI channel
- `/.gitignore` - Exclude built binary

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite for:

- Error handling
- Connection management

## Conclusion

This feature successfully transforms the RubberDuck CLI into a modern, efficient client-server architecture that provides better performance, user experience, and maintainability while opening up possibilities for remote access and advanced features.
