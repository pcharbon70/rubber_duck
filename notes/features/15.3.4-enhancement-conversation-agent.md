# Feature: Enhancement Conversation Agent (15.3.4)

## Overview

Transform the enhancement coordination system into an autonomous agent that handles code and content enhancement conversations asynchronously using signal-based communication.

## Analysis of Existing Code

### Current Implementation
1. **RubberDuck.Enhancement.Coordinator**: Central coordinator for LLM enhancement techniques
   - Manages CoT, RAG, and Self-Correction technique selection
   - Handles pipeline building and execution
   - Supports A/B testing for technique comparison
   - Tracks enhancement metrics

2. **Enhancement Techniques Available**:
   - Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Self-Correction iterative improvement
   - Parallel and conditional pipelines

3. **No Existing Enhancement Conversation Engine**: Unlike other conversation types, there's no dedicated enhancement conversation engine

### Key Functionality to Preserve
- Enhancement technique selection and composition
- Pipeline building (sequential, parallel, conditional)
- A/B testing capabilities
- Metrics collection and tracking
- Integration with existing enhancement coordinator

## Design Decisions

### 1. Agent Architecture
- Use BaseAgent for common functionality
- Create a conversation-focused enhancement agent
- Integrate with existing Enhancement.Coordinator
- Support iterative enhancement workflows

### 2. Signal Types
- `enhancement_request`: Request content/code enhancement
- `technique_selection`: Signal for technique selection events
- `enhancement_progress`: Progress updates during enhancement
- `enhancement_result`: Final enhanced content
- `suggestion_generated`: Individual enhancement suggestions
- `validation_request`: Request validation of enhancements
- `feedback_received`: User feedback on enhancements

### 3. State Management
```elixir
schema: [
  enhancement_queue: [type: {:list, :map}, default: []],
  active_enhancements: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  enhancement_history: [type: {:list, :map}, default: []],
  suggestion_cache: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  validation_results: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  metrics: [type: :map, default: %{
    total_enhancements: 0,
    suggestions_generated: 0,
    suggestions_accepted: 0,
    avg_improvement_score: 0.0,
    technique_effectiveness: %{}
  }],
  enhancement_config: [type: :map, default: %{
    default_techniques: [:cot, :self_correction],
    max_suggestions: 5,
    validation_enabled: true
  }]
]
```

### 4. Async Operations
- Enhancement coordination runs asynchronously
- Technique application is parallelizable
- Validation can run in background
- Progress signals for long operations

### 5. Integration Points
- Use existing Enhancement.Coordinator for technique execution
- Integrate with CoT chains for reasoning
- Support validation through test generation
- Track metrics for learning and improvement

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Agent Structure
1. Create EnhancementConversationAgent module with BaseAgent
2. Define comprehensive schema for enhancement state
3. Implement basic signal routing

### Phase 2: Enhancement Request Handling
1. Implement enhancement_request signal handler
2. Create conversation context building
3. Integrate with Enhancement.Coordinator

### Phase 3: Suggestion Generation
1. Implement suggestion workflow
2. Add context analysis for relevance
3. Create ranking and filtering system

### Phase 4: Validation System
1. Implement validation protocols
2. Add test generation for code enhancements
3. Create impact analysis

### Phase 5: Tracking and Learning
1. Implement enhancement tracking
2. Add outcome measurement
3. Create feedback collection system

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
1. Create comprehensive test suite
2. Document all signal formats
3. Add usage examples

## Signal Flow Examples

### Enhancement Request Flow
```
1. Receive enhancement_request signal
   - content, context, preferences, request_id
2. Emit enhancement_progress (analyzing)
3. Select techniques based on content type
4. Emit technique_selection signal
5. Apply enhancement techniques (async)
6. Generate suggestions
7. Emit suggestion_generated signals
8. If validation enabled, emit validation_request
9. Collect and rank results
10. Emit enhancement_result signal
```

### Iterative Enhancement Flow
```
1. Receive enhancement_request with previous_result
2. Analyze previous enhancement effectiveness
3. Select different/refined techniques
4. Apply incremental improvements
5. Validate against original goals
6. Emit enhancement_result with iterations
```

### Feedback Learning Flow
```
1. Receive feedback_received signal
2. Update suggestion acceptance metrics
3. Adjust technique effectiveness scores
4. Update enhancement history
5. Emit metrics_updated signal
```

## Success Criteria
- Smooth integration with existing enhancement system
- Async operations with progress tracking
- Clear suggestion generation and ranking
- Effective validation system
- Comprehensive metrics for improvement
