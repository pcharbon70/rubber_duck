# Feature: Iterative Self-Correction Engine

## Summary
Implement self-correction mechanisms with feedback loops for improving LLM outputs, building upon existing validation and refinement patterns in the codebase.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create `RubberDuck.SelfCorrection.Engine` module as central coordinator
- [ ] Implement correction strategies (syntax validation, semantic consistency, logic verification)
- [ ] Build evaluation framework with quality metrics and error detection
- [ ] Create correction application logic (targeted corrections, full regeneration, partial updates)
- [ ] Implement iteration control (limits, convergence detection, early stopping)
- [ ] Add correction history tracking for learning
- [ ] Create feedback aggregation from multiple sources
- [ ] Implement learning from corrections for continuous improvement
- [ ] Build correction effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Add correction result caching for performance

## Research Summary

### Existing Patterns to Leverage

1. **CoT Validator** (`cot/validator.ex`):
   - Quality scoring across multiple dimensions
   - Logical flow validation
   - Completeness checking
   - Can be generalized for any LLM output

2. **Code Refinement Engine** (`engines/generation/refinement.ex`):
   - Already has iterative refinement loop
   - Convergence detection
   - Change tracking
   - Multiple feedback types

3. **RAG Metrics** (`rag/metrics.ex`):
   - User feedback collection
   - Quality tracking over time
   - A/B testing framework

4. **Context Scorer** (`context/scorer.ex`):
   - Multi-factor quality assessment
   - Improvement suggestions
   - Comparison framework

5. **Adaptive Selector** (`context/adaptive_selector.ex`):
   - Learning from performance
   - Weight adjustment algorithms
   - Historical tracking

### Technical Approach

The self-correction engine will act as a meta-layer that:

1. **Orchestrates Existing Components**:
   - Use CoT Validator for quality assessment
   - Leverage Refinement Engine for code improvements
   - Apply Context Scorer for information quality
   - Integrate RAG Metrics for tracking

2. **Unified Correction Framework**:
   - Common interface for all correction types
   - Plugin architecture for correction strategies
   - Configurable iteration policies

3. **Learning System**:
   - Build on Adaptive Selector's learning approach
   - Track correction effectiveness
   - Adjust strategies based on outcomes

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache validation results
   - Parallel correction attempts
   - Early stopping based on confidence

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Infinite correction loops | High | Implement strict iteration limits and convergence detection |
| Performance degradation | High | Use caching, early stopping, and parallel processing |
| Over-correction | Medium | Track quality metrics to ensure improvements |
| Conflicting corrections | Medium | Priority system for correction strategies |
| Memory usage from history | Low | Implement rolling window for correction history |

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should self-correction be automatic or require explicit enablement?
2. What should be the default iteration limit to balance quality vs performance?
3. Should we prioritize certain types of corrections (e.g., errors over style)?
4. How aggressive should the learning system be in adjusting strategies?
5. Should correction history be persisted across sessions?
