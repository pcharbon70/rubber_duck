# Feature 4.1: Reactor Workflow Foundation

## Overview
Set up the Reactor framework for defining and executing complex workflows with automatic parallelization and error handling. This feature establishes the foundation for all workflow orchestration in RubberDuck.

## Background
Reactor is a dynamic, concurrent, dependency-resolving saga orchestrator that provides:
- Transaction-like semantics across multiple resources
- Automatic dependency resolution and concurrent execution
- Compensation/rollback capabilities for error handling
- Both static DSL and dynamic workflow definition

## Implementation Tasks

### 4.1.1 Add Reactor Dependency
- Add `{:reactor, "~> 0.15.6"}` to mix.exs dependencies
- Run `mix deps.get` to fetch the dependency
- Verify installation and version

### 4.1.2 Create Workflows Module Structure
Create the following module hierarchy:
```
lib/rubber_duck/workflows/
├── workflow.ex          # Base workflow behavior
├── registry.ex          # Workflow registry
├── executor.ex          # Execution engine
├── step.ex              # Step behavior
├── result.ex            # Step result handling
├── cache.ex             # Result caching
├── metrics.ex           # Metrics collection
└── dsl.ex               # Custom DSL extensions
```

### 4.1.3 Implement Base Workflow Behaviors
- Define workflow behavior with required callbacks
- Create macros for workflow definition
- Implement workflow metadata handling
- Support both DSL and dynamic workflow creation

### 4.1.4 Create Workflow Registry
- GenServer-based registry for named workflows
- Dynamic registration/deregistration
- Workflow lookup by name or tag
- Registry introspection capabilities

### 4.1.5 Set Up Workflow Execution Engine
- GenServer for managing workflow execution
- Support for concurrent step execution
- Dependency resolution using Reactor's DAG
- Progress tracking and reporting

### 4.1.6 Implement Step Result Caching
- ETS-based caching for step results
- Configurable TTL per step
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Optional persistence to database

### 4.1.7 Add Workflow Status Tracking
- Track workflow state (pending, running, completed, failed)
- Step-level status tracking
- Progress percentage calculation
- Event emission for status changes

### 4.1.8 Create Workflow Cancellation Support
- Graceful cancellation with cleanup
- Compensation action triggering
- Partial result preservation
- Cancellation reason tracking

### 4.1.9 Implement Workflow Composition
- Workflows as steps in other workflows
- Nested workflow execution
- Context passing between workflows
- Result aggregation

### 4.1.10 Add Workflow Versioning
- Version tracking for workflow definitions
- Migration support between versions
- Compatibility checking
- Version-specific execution

### 4.1.11 Set Up Workflow Metrics Collection
- Telemetry integration
- Execution time tracking
- Success/failure rates
- Resource usage metrics

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Workflow Definition**
   ```elixir
   defmodule MyWorkflow do
     use RubberDuck.Workflows.Workflow
     
     workflow do
       step :fetch_data do
         run DataFetcher
         max_retries 3
       end
       
       step :process_data do
         run DataProcessor
         argument :data, result(:fetch_data)
       end
       
       step :save_results do
         run ResultSaver
         argument :processed, result(:process_data)
         compensate ResultCleaner
       end
     end
   end
   ```

2. **Dynamic Workflow Building**
   ```elixir
   workflow = Workflow.new("dynamic_workflow")
   |> Workflow.add_step(:step1, StepModule1)
   |> Workflow.add_step(:step2, StepModule2, depends_on: [:step1])
   |> Workflow.build()
   ```

3. **Execution Engine**
   - Manages workflow lifecycle
   - Handles concurrent execution
   - Provides hooks for monitoring
   - Supports middleware injection

## Integration Points

1. **With Existing Engines**
   - Workflows can orchestrate engine operations
   - Engines can be wrapped as workflow steps
   - Shared context between engines and workflows

2. **With Memory System**
   - Workflow results stored in memory
   - Historical workflow data for learning
   - Pattern extraction from workflow executions

3. **With LLM Service**
   - LLM calls as workflow steps
   - Intelligent workflow composition
   - Dynamic step generation based on context

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual workflow components
   - Mock step execution
   - Verify dependency resolution
   - Test error handling paths

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end workflow execution
   - Multi-step workflows with dependencies
   - Error recovery and compensation
   - Concurrent execution verification

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure workflow overhead
   - Test with large DAGs
   - Concurrent workflow execution
   - Memory usage under load

## Success Criteria

- Reactor successfully integrated
- Base workflow modules implemented
- Registry supports dynamic workflow management
- Execution engine handles complex dependencies
- Caching improves performance measurably
- All unit tests pass
- Documentation complete with examples

## Future Enhancements
