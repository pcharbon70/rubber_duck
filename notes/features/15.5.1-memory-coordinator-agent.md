## Research Summary

### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- **Jido Framework**: Functional OTP-based toolkit with pure functions, tagged tuples, schema validation
- **Ash Framework**: Domain-driven resource management with proper data layer abstraction
- **BaseAgent Pattern**: RubberDuck-specific Jido agent enhancements with lifecycle hooks

### Documentation Reviewed
- **Jido Usage Rules**: Agent patterns, signal handling, OTP integration, testing strategies
- **Ash Framework**: Domain/resource structure, action definitions, query patterns
- **Memory System**: Three-tier architecture (short/mid/long-term), existing Manager patterns

### Existing Patterns Found
- **Memory.Manager**: `lib/rubber_duck/memory/manager.ex:1-273` - GenServer coordination across memory tiers
- **Agents.Coordinator**: `lib/rubber_duck/agents/coordinator.ex:1-633` - Agent orchestration and workflow management
- **BaseAgent**: `lib/rubber_duck/agents/base_agent.ex:1-100` - Jido agent base with RubberDuck enhancements
- **Memory Domain**: `lib/rubber_duck/memory.ex:1-71` - Ash domain with resource definitions
- **TokenManagerAgent**: Complex state management with signal handling and buffer management

### Technical Approach

**Architecture:**
1. **Jido Agent Foundation**: Use `RubberDuck.Agents.BaseAgent` for core agent functionality
2. **Memory Domain Integration**: Extend existing Memory domain with coordination actions
3. **Multi-Tier Coordination**: Build on existing Memory.Manager patterns for cross-tier operations
4. **Signal-Based Communication**: Use Jido signals for distributed coordination
5. **OTP Supervision**: Integrate with existing agent supervision trees

**Core Components:**
1. **Memory Orchestration Engine**: Coordinates operations across memory tiers
2. **Partitioning Manager**: Handles intelligent memory distribution and sharding
3. **Synchronization Service**: Manages consistency across distributed memory
4. **Replication Controller**: Ensures high availability through strategic replication
5. **Conflict Resolver**: Handles synchronization conflicts with versioning
6. **Access Control Manager**: Enforces permissions and isolation
7. **Metrics Collector**: Tracks performance and optimization opportunities

**Signal Interface:**
- `memory_operation_request` - Coordinate complex memory operations
- `sync_memory_tiers` - Trigger synchronization across tiers
- `memory_health_check` - Monitor memory system health
- `memory_optimization` - Execute optimization algorithms
- `memory_backup` - Create snapshots and backups

**State Schema:**
```elixir
schema: [
  coordination_status: [type: :atom, values: [:idle, :coordinating, :syncing, :optimizing], default: :idle],
  active_operations: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  memory_partitions: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  sync_state: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  replication_topology: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  access_permissions: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  performance_metrics: [type: :map, default: %{}]
]
```

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Memory inconsistency during coordination | High | Implement ACID-like transactions with rollback capabilities |
| Performance overhead from coordination | Medium | Use async operations and intelligent batching |
| Complex distributed state management | High | Follow existing Memory.Manager patterns and add comprehensive testing |
| Signal flooding during high load | Medium | Implement backpressure and rate limiting |
| Memory leaks in coordination logic | Medium | Add proper cleanup in lifecycle hooks and scheduled maintenance |

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should the Memory Coordinator Agent replace the existing Memory.Manager or work alongside it?
2. What level of memory encryption is needed for sensitive data?
3. Are there specific consistency models preferred (eventual consistency vs strong consistency)?
4. Should we implement memory compression as part of the coordination?
5. What are the priority use cases for memory coordination in the current system?
