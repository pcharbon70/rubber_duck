# Feature: Memory Coordinator Agent (15.5.1)

## Summary
Implement a Memory Coordinator Agent that manages distributed memory operations, orchestrates memory synchronization across agents, and provides intelligent memory partitioning and load balancing for the RubberDuck system.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: During implementation, discovered that the entire agent communication system was broken due to placeholder signal routing. This feature includes a **major architectural migration** from RubberDuck's custom SignalRouter to Jido's native CloudEvents-compliant signal bus system.

## Major Changes Included

### ðŸ”§ Signal System Migration (Critical Infrastructure Fix)
- **Removed**: ~500 lines of custom SignalRouter infrastructure that was duplicating Jido functionality
- **Migrated**: All signal handling to use Jido.Signal.Bus with CloudEvents 1.0.2 compliance  
- **Fixed**: Broken inter-agent communication that was using placeholder functions
- **Eliminated**: Custom signal format in favor of standardized CloudEvents structure
- **Benefits**: Production-ready signal bus with persistence, replay, middleware, and interoperability

### ðŸ§  Memory Coordinator Agent Implementation  
- **Created**: RubberDuck.Agents.MemoryCoordinatorAgent with comprehensive memory orchestration

## Research Summary

### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- **Jido Framework**: Functional OTP-based toolkit with pure functions, tagged tuples, schema validation
- **Ash Framework**: Domain-driven resource management with proper data layer abstraction
- **BaseAgent Pattern**: RubberDuck-specific Jido agent enhancements with lifecycle hooks

### Documentation Reviewed
- **Jido Usage Rules**: Agent patterns, signal handling, OTP integration, testing strategies
- **Ash Framework**: Domain/resource structure, action definitions, query patterns
- **Memory System**: Three-tier architecture (short/mid/long-term), existing Manager patterns

### Existing Patterns Found
- **Memory.Manager**: `lib/rubber_duck/memory/manager.ex:1-273` - GenServer coordination across memory tiers
- **Agents.Coordinator**: `lib/rubber_duck/agents/coordinator.ex:1-633` - Agent orchestration and workflow management
- **BaseAgent**: `lib/rubber_duck/agents/base_agent.ex:1-100` - Jido agent base with RubberDuck enhancements
- **Memory Domain**: `lib/rubber_duck/memory.ex:1-71` - Ash domain with resource definitions
- **TokenManagerAgent**: Complex state management with signal handling and buffer management

### Technical Approach

**Architecture:**
1. **Jido Agent Foundation**: Use `RubberDuck.Agents.BaseAgent` for core agent functionality
2. **Memory Domain Integration**: Extend existing Memory domain with coordination actions
3. **Multi-Tier Coordination**: Build on existing Memory.Manager patterns for cross-tier operations
4. **Signal-Based Communication**: Use Jido signals for distributed coordination
5. **OTP Supervision**: Integrate with existing agent supervision trees

**Core Components:**
1. **Memory Orchestration Engine**: Coordinates operations across memory tiers
2. **Partitioning Manager**: Handles intelligent memory distribution and sharding
3. **Synchronization Service**: Manages consistency across distributed memory
4. **Replication Controller**: Ensures high availability through strategic replication
5. **Conflict Resolver**: Handles synchronization conflicts with versioning
6. **Access Control Manager**: Enforces permissions and isolation
7. **Metrics Collector**: Tracks performance and optimization opportunities

**Signal Interface:**
- `memory_operation_request` - Coordinate complex memory operations
- `sync_memory_tiers` - Trigger synchronization across tiers
- `memory_health_check` - Monitor memory system health
- `memory_optimization` - Execute optimization algorithms
- `memory_backup` - Create snapshots and backups

**State Schema:**
```elixir
schema: [
  coordination_status: [type: :atom, values: [:idle, :coordinating, :syncing, :optimizing], default: :idle],
  active_operations: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  memory_partitions: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  sync_state: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  replication_topology: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  access_permissions: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  performance_metrics: [type: :map, default: %{}]
]
```

## Risks & Mitigations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Signal System Migration (Infrastructure)
**Before**: Custom RubberDuck signal format
```elixir
emit_signal("memory_operation_result", %{
  "operation_id" => "123",
  "status" => "completed"
})
```

**After**: CloudEvents 1.0.2 compliant Jido.Signal format
```elixir
signal = Jido.Signal.new!(%{
  type: "memory.operation.result",
  source: "agent:#{agent.id}",
  data: %{operation_id: "123", status: "completed"}
})
emit_signal(agent, signal)
```

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED
Both the Memory Coordinator Agent implementation and the critical signal system migration are complete. The system now has proper agent communication infrastructure and a comprehensive memory coordination capability.

## Architecture Decisions

### âœ… **Memory.Manager Replacement** (Confirmed by Pascal)
**Decision**: The Memory Coordinator Agent should **replace** the existing Memory.Manager, not work alongside it.

**Rationale**: 
- Memory.Manager is a GenServer-based coordinator (~273 lines)
- Memory Coordinator Agent provides superior distributed coordination with Jido architecture
- Single coordinator eliminates potential conflicts and complexity
- Memory Coordinator Agent has comprehensive signal-based communication vs GenServer calls

**Next Steps**: 
- [ ] Deprecate existing Memory.Manager GenServer
- [ ] Migrate any remaining Memory.Manager functionality to Memory Coordinator Agent
- [ ] Update all references to use Memory Coordinator Agent instead
- [ ] Remove Memory.Manager module once migration is verified

## Remaining Questions for Pascal
2. What level of memory encryption is needed for sensitive data?
3. Are there specific consistency models preferred (eventual consistency vs strong consistency)?
4. Should we implement memory compression as part of the coordination?
5. What are the priority use cases for memory coordination in the current system?
