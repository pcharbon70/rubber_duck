# Feature: Security-First Template Processing

## Summary
Implement comprehensive security measures for template processing including multi-layered validation, sandboxed execution, rate limiting, and security monitoring to prevent injection attacks and ensure safe execution of user-provided instructions.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create SecurityPipeline module for coordinating all security measures
- [ ] Implement multi-stage input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add sandboxed execution environment for template processing
- [ ] Create comprehensive audit logging for security events
- [ ] Implement advanced template validation beyond existing basic checks
- [ ] Build variable sanitization with enhanced protection
- [ ] Create execution sandbox with resource limits
- [ ] Implement rate limiting at multiple levels (user, template, global)
- [ ] Add security monitoring with attack detection
- [ ] Create security audit tools and penetration testing suite

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- No specific usage rules found for security libraries
- ExRated is already in use for rate limiting in LLM service

### Documentation Reviewed
- ExRated: Rate limiting library already used in LLM service for API rate limiting
- Telemetry: Already integrated for metrics and monitoring
- Solid: Template engine with built-in safety features for user templates

### Existing Patterns Found
- Security module exists: `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/security.ex` with basic validation
- Rate limiting pattern: `lib/rubber_duck/llm/service.ex:check_rate_limit/1` using ExRated
- Telemetry integration: `lib/rubber_duck/telemetry.ex` for metrics
- Error handling: `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/errors.ex` with SecurityError
- Template processing: `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/template_processor.ex` already integrates with Security module

### Technical Approach
1. **SecurityPipeline Architecture**:
   - Create a GenServer-based pipeline that coordinates all security measures
   - Implement as middleware that wraps template processing
   - Use telemetry for security event tracking
   - Integrate with existing Security module

2. **Enhanced Validation**:
   - Extend existing Security module validation
   - Add more sophisticated pattern detection
   - Implement AST-based analysis for complex attack patterns
   - Add context-aware validation

3. **Sandboxed Execution**:
   - Leverage existing sandbox_context/1 function
   - Add process-based isolation using Task with timeouts
   - Implement memory limits using Process.flag(:max_heap_size)
   - Restrict module access through custom guards

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - Create SecurityAudit Ash resource for structured logging
   - Use Ash framework with AshPostgres for audit log persistence
   - Include request context, user info, and outcomes
   - Integrate with telemetry for metrics

5. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Reuse ExRated patterns from LLM service
   - Implement hierarchical buckets (user -> template -> global)
   - Add adaptive throttling based on security scores
   - Create RateLimiter module for template-specific limits

6. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Build on telemetry infrastructure
   - Create SecurityMonitor GenServer for real-time analysis
   - Implement sliding window for anomaly detection
   - Add configurable alert thresholds

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance overhead from security checks | High | Implement caching for validation results, use ETS for rate limiting state |
| False positives blocking legitimate templates | Medium | Create configurable security levels, whitelist known-safe patterns |
| Resource exhaustion from sandboxing | Medium | Use pooled processes, implement circuit breaker pattern |
| Audit log growth | Low | Implement log rotation, use time-series compression |
| Complex attack patterns evading detection | High | Regular security review, pattern updates, community threat intelligence |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/security_pipeline.ex` GenServer
- [ ] Extend `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/security.ex` with advanced validation
- [ ] Create `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/security_audit.ex` for logging
- [ ] Create `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/rate_limiter.ex` for template rate limiting
- [ ] Create `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/sandbox_executor.ex` for isolated execution
- [ ] Create `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/security_monitor.ex` for real-time monitoring
- [ ] Update `lib/rubber_duck/instructions/template_processor.ex` to use SecurityPipeline
- [ ] Add security telemetry events throughout the system
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite in `test/rubber_duck/instructions/security_test.exs`
- [ ] Add security configuration to application config
- [ ] Create security audit tools and penetration tests
- [ ] Verify no performance regressions

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) style rule engine for more sophisticated attack detection?
2. What level of audit logging detail is appropriate (considering storage vs security needs)?
3. Should rate limiting be configurable per-project or global only?
4. Do we need integration with external security services (e.g., threat intelligence feeds)?
5. What should be the default security level - strict or balanced?
