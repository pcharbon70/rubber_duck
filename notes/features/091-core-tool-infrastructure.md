# Feature: Core Tool Infrastructure (Phase 9.1)

## Summary
Build the foundation for tool definition and registration using Spark DSL for declarative configuration, with compile-time validation and code generation capabilities. This will create a sophisticated, declarative tool system with unified tool access for internal engines and external clients.

## Requirements
- [x] Create Spark DSL extension for tool definition with metadata, parameters, execution, and security sections
- [x] Implement ETS-backed tool registry with concurrent access and hot reloading
- [x] Build JSON Schema generation from Spark DSL parameter definitions
- [x] Create tool compilation pipeline with compile-time validation
- [ ] Implement tool lifecycle management (initialization, shutdown, health checking)
- [ ] Add tool documentation generator from DSL definitions
- [x] Support tool versioning and compatibility checking
- [ ] Enable hot reloading in development mode

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Spark DSL: Provides framework for building extensible DSLs with compile-time safety
- ETS best practices: Use named tables with read_concurrency: true for high-performance lookups
- Registry pattern: Found existing registry implementations in codebase to follow

### Documentation Reviewed
- Spark DSL: Entities define structure, transformers enable compile-time modifications, verifiers provide validation
- ETS: Efficient in-memory storage with :set type for unique keys, concurrent access patterns
- JSON Schema: No direct Elixir type-to-schema generators found, will need custom implementation

### Existing Patterns Found
- Pattern 1: [lib/rubber_duck/engine/capability_registry.ex] - GenServer-based registry with ETS backing
- Pattern 2: [lib/rubber_duck/instructions/registry.ex] - ETS tables with versioning and hot reload
- Pattern 3: Multiple registry implementations use similar patterns for discovery and lookup

### Technical Approach
1. **Spark DSL Extension**: Create `RubberDuck.Tool.DSL` module extending `Spark.Dsl.Extension` with sections for:
   - Metadata section (name, description, category, version)
   - Parameters entity with type specifications
   - Execution configuration (handler, timeout, async, retries)
   - Security configuration (sandbox, capabilities, rate limits)

2. **Registry Implementation**: Follow existing registry patterns with:
   - GenServer managing ETS tables for tools
   - Concurrent read access with `:read_concurrency` option
   - Version tracking using content hashing
   - Hot reload support via file system monitoring

3. **JSON Schema Generation**: Build custom converter that:
   - Traverses Spark DSL parameter definitions
   - Maps Elixir types to JSON Schema types
   - Includes validation constraints from DSL
   - Generates examples and documentation

4. **Compilation Pipeline**: Use Spark transformers and verifiers for:
   - Compile-time validation of tool definitions
   - Code generation for execution modules
   - TypeScript definition generation for clients
   - Documentation extraction

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Complex DSL implementation | High | Start with minimal DSL, iterate based on needs |
| Performance of many tools | Medium | Use ETS with proper indexing, benchmark early |
| JSON Schema type mapping gaps | Medium | Define clear type mapping rules, handle edge cases |
| Hot reload race conditions | Low | Use proper synchronization, test thoroughly |

- [ ] Build `lib/rubber_duck/tool/compiler.ex`
- [ ] Implement compile-time validation using verifiers
- [ ] Generate execution modules from DSL

- [ ] Implement hot reloading for development
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for full pipeline

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we support dynamic tool registration at runtime, or only compile-time?
   - **Answer**: Support dynamic tool registration at runtime for intermittent tool usage
2. What level of sandboxing is needed for tool execution initially?
   - **Answer**: TBD - need more context on sandboxing requirements
3. Should tool versioning support multiple versions running simultaneously?
   - **Answer**: Yes, support multiple versions running simultaneously with semantic versioning
4. Do we need to integrate with the removed MCP system later, or build our own protocol?
   - **Answer**: MCP integration is in a later step (section 9.7)

## Decisions Made
- Tool versioning will use semantic versioning (e.g., 1.2.3)
- No deprecation lifecycle needed initially
- Registry will support categories/tags for tool organization
