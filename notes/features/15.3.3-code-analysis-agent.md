# Feature: Code Analysis Agent (15.3.3)

## Overview

Transform the existing code analysis engines (Analysis and AnalysisConversation) into an autonomous agent that performs code analysis operations asynchronously using signal-based communication.

## Analysis of Existing Code

### Current Implementation
1. **RubberDuck.Engines.Analysis**: Performs static analysis combined with LLM-enhanced insights
   - Static analysis for Elixir code (unused variables, missing docs, code smells)
   - LLM enhancement for deeper insights
   - CoT integration for comprehensive analysis
   - Metrics calculation and summary generation

2. **RubberDuck.Engines.Conversation.AnalysisConversation**: Handles code analysis conversations
   - Code review discussions
   - Architecture analysis
   - Performance analysis
   - Security review
   - Best practices discussions
   - Uses AnalysisChain for thorough examination

### Key Functionality to Preserve
- Static code analysis (language-specific)
- LLM-enhanced insights
- CoT chain integration
- Multiple analysis types (security, performance, architecture, etc.)
- Metrics and summary generation
- Issue categorization and prioritization

## Design Decisions

### 1. Agent Architecture
- Use BaseAgent for common functionality
- Combine both engines into a single comprehensive agent
- Maintain support for both file analysis and conversational analysis

### 2. Signal Types
- `code_analysis_request`: Analyze a specific file
- `conversation_analysis_request`: Analyze code within conversation context
- `analysis_result`: Emitted when analysis completes
- `analysis_progress`: Progress updates for long-running analysis
- `enhancement_complete`: When LLM enhancement finishes

### 3. State Management
```elixir
schema: [
  analysis_queue: [type: {:list, :map}, default: []],
  active_analyses: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  analysis_cache: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  metrics: [type: :map, default: %{
    files_analyzed: 0,
    total_issues: 0,
    analysis_time_ms: 0,
    cache_hits: 0
  }],
  analyzers: [type: {:list, :atom}, default: [:static, :security, :style]],
  llm_config: [type: :map, default: %{temperature: 0.3, max_tokens: 2000}]
]
```

### 4. Async Operations
- Static analysis runs synchronously (fast)
- LLM enhancement runs asynchronously
- CoT chain execution runs asynchronously
- Progress signals emitted during long analyses

### 5. Integration Points
- Reuse existing AnalysisChain for CoT integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing analysis result format
- Support both direct file analysis and conversational context

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Agent Structure
1. Create CodeAnalysisAgent module with BaseAgent
2. Define comprehensive schema
3. Implement basic signal routing

### Phase 2: Analysis Functionality
1. Port static analysis logic from Analysis engine
2. Implement file reading and language detection
3. Create analysis queue management

### Phase 3: LLM Enhancement
1. Transform LLM calls to async operations
2. Implement enhancement signal flow
3. Add caching for repeated analyses

### Phase 4: CoT Integration
1. Integrate with existing AnalysisChain
2. Handle CoT session results
3. Merge static and CoT results

### Phase 5: Conversational Analysis
1. Port AnalysisConversation functionality
2. Support context-aware analysis
3. Detect analysis types from queries

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
1. Create comprehensive test suite
2. Document all signal formats
3. Add usage examples

## Signal Flow Examples

### File Analysis Flow
```
1. Receive code_analysis_request signal
   - file_path, options, request_id
2. Emit analysis_progress (started)
3. Run static analysis (sync)
4. Start LLM enhancement (async)
5. Start CoT chain (async)
6. Emit analysis_progress (enhancing)
7. Merge all results
8. Emit analysis_result signal
```

### Conversation Analysis Flow
```
1. Receive conversation_analysis_request signal
   - query, code, context, request_id
2. Detect analysis type from query
3. Build CoT context
4. Execute AnalysisChain (async)
5. Extract and structure results
6. Emit analysis_result signal
```

## Success Criteria
- All existing analysis functionality preserved
- Async operations don't block agent
- Clear signal-based communication
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance metrics tracked
