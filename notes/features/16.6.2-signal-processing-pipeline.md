# Feature: Signal Processing Pipeline (16.6.2)

## Summary
Implement a comprehensive signal processing pipeline with transformers and monitoring for the RubberDuck platform. This pipeline will provide signal transformation, enrichment, validation, security filtering, and detailed monitoring capabilities. All signals will be proper Jido signals using CloudEvents specification.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create signal transformers for format validation and normalization
- [ ] Implement data enrichment and augmentation capabilities
- [ ] Add schema validation and enforcement
- [ ] Provide security filtering and sanitization
- [ ] Implement delivery tracking and confirmation
- [ ] Add latency and throughput metrics
- [ ] Monitor error rates and patterns
- [ ] Track queue depth and backpressure
- [ ] Optimize performance throughout the pipeline
- [ ] Ensure all signals remain CloudEvents-compliant via Jido.Signal

## Research Summary

### Existing Patterns Found
- **SignalAdapter**: Already handles signal routing with preprocessing
- **SignalValidator**: Validates signals against CloudEvents spec
- **SignalRouter**: Routes signals to handlers
- **Jido.Signal**: Core signal creation and validation

### Technical Approach

1. **Signal Transformers**:
   - **Normalizer**: Standardize signal formats
   - **Enricher**: Add contextual data and metadata
   - **SchemaValidator**: Enforce signal schemas
   - **SecurityFilter**: Remove sensitive data
   - **Optimizer**: Compress and optimize payloads

2. **Signal Monitoring**:
   - **DeliveryTracker**: Track signal delivery status
   - **MetricsCollector**: Collect performance metrics
   - **ErrorAnalyzer**: Analyze error patterns
   - **BackpressureMonitor**: Monitor queue health
   - **PerformanceProfiler**: Profile pipeline performance

3. **Pipeline Architecture**:
   ```
   Signal → Transformers → Validation → Routing → Monitoring → Delivery
   ```

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance overhead from transformations | High | Use streaming and lazy evaluation |
| Memory usage from monitoring | Medium | Implement sampling and aggregation |
| Schema drift breaking validation | High | Support schema versioning |
| Security filter removing required data | Medium | Whitelist critical fields |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `lib/rubber_duck/jido/signals/pipeline/` directory
- [ ] Implement `SignalTransformer` behaviour
- [ ] Create `SignalNormalizer` for format standardization
- [ ] Create `SignalEnricher` for data augmentation
- [ ] Create `SchemaValidator` for schema enforcement
- [ ] Create `SecurityFilter` for sensitive data removal
- [ ] Create `SignalOptimizer` for payload optimization
- [ ] Implement `SignalMonitor` behaviour
- [ ] Create `DeliveryTracker` for tracking delivery
- [ ] Create `MetricsCollector` for performance metrics
- [ ] Create `ErrorAnalyzer` for error pattern analysis
- [ ] Create `BackpressureMonitor` for queue monitoring
- [ ] Create `PipelineOrchestrator` to coordinate all components
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Update documentation

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should transformers be configurable per signal type or global?
2. What level of monitoring detail is needed (sampling rate)?
3. Should we support custom transformer plugins?
4. How long should monitoring data be retained?
