# Section 12.3: File Tree Component - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive file tree component for the collaborative coding interface, providing an interactive way to navigate project files with real-time updates and advanced features.

## Components Created

### 1. FileTreeComponent (`lib/rubber_duck_web/components/file_tree_component.ex`)
A full-featured LiveComponent that provides:
- **Recursive tree rendering** with expand/collapse functionality
- **File selection** with single and multi-selection support (Ctrl/Cmd click)
- **Search functionality** with real-time filtering
- **File type icons** with visual differentiation
- **Git status indicators** showing modified, added, deleted files
- **Keyboard navigation** with arrow keys and Vim-style shortcuts
- **Hidden file toggle** to show/hide dotfiles
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **File count display** in status bar

### 2. FileTree Module (`lib/rubber_duck/projects/file_tree.ex`)
Backend module for file system operations:
- **Directory traversal** with configurable depth limits
- **File filtering** with ignored patterns (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- **Git status integration** using git CLI
- **Search functionality** with extension filtering
- **File system watching** support (prepared for real-time updates)

### 3. JavaScript Hooks (`assets/js/hooks/file_tree_hooks.js`)
Client-side enhancements:
- **FocusOnMount**: Auto-focuses and selects search input
- **FileTreeKeyboard**: Handles keyboard navigation including Vim keys
- **FileTreeDragDrop**: Drag and drop support for file operations
- **FileTreeVirtualScroll**: Performance optimization for large trees

### 4. Integration Updates
- Updated `CodingSessionLive` to:
  - Include FileTreeComponent in the layout
  - Handle file selection events
  - Load file tree data asynchronously
  - Broadcast file selections to other users
- Added FileTree hooks to `app.js`
- Added custom CSS for file tree styling

### 5. Tests (`test/rubber_duck_web/components/file_tree_component_test.exs`)
Comprehensive test coverage including:
- Tree rendering and structure
- Expand/collapse functionality
- File selection behavior
- Search and filtering
- Keyboard navigation
- Hidden file visibility toggle

## Key Features Implemented

### Visual Features
- **Tree Structure**: Indented hierarchy with expand/collapse arrows
- **File Icons**: Different icons for file types (.ex, .js, .md, etc.)
- **Selection Highlighting**: Visual feedback for selected and active files
- **Search Highlighting**: Matched text highlighted in yellow
- **Git Status**: Inline indicators for file changes
- **File Sizes**: Human-readable sizes for files
- **Loading Spinner**: During initial load

### Interaction Features
- **Click to Select**: Single click selects files
- **Ctrl/Cmd Click**: Multi-selection support
- **Double Click**: Opens files (sends event to parent)
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Arrow keys for navigation
  - Enter to open files
  - j/k/h/l for Vim-style movement
- **Search**: Real-time filtering with debouncing
- **Drag and Drop**: Prepared for file uploads

### Performance Optimizations
- **Async Loading**: File tree loads without blocking UI
- **Lazy Loading**: Deep directories can be loaded on demand
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Hook prepared for large file lists
- **Debounced Search**: 300ms delay on search input
- **Filtered Rendering**: Only visible nodes are rendered

## Architecture Decisions

### Component Communication
- LiveComponent requests data from parent LiveView
- Parent handles async operations to work around LiveComponent limitations
- Public functions for updating component state from parent
- Events bubble up to parent for file selection handling

### File System Integration
- Separate module for file operations (FileTree)
- Git status via CLI commands
- Configurable ignore patterns
- Support for hidden files toggle

### State Management
- Expanded paths tracked in MapSet for efficiency
- Selected paths in MapSet for multi-selection
- Active path for keyboard navigation
- Search query with real-time filtering

## Future Enhancements
The implementation is prepared for:
- Real-time file system watching with FileSystem
- Drag and drop file uploads
- Context menu operations (rename, delete, etc.)
- File previews on hover
- Virtual scrolling for massive directories
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Integration with Monaco editor

## Technical Notes
- Used Task.async for non-blocking file tree loading
- LiveComponent limitations worked around with parent communication
- Git integration uses System.cmd for portability
- Prepared PubSub topics for real-time updates
- Accessible with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes
