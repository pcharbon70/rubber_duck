# Protocol-based Extensibility

## Overview
Implement Elixir protocols to provide flexible extension points for different data types and processing strategies. This allows the system to be extended for new data types without modifying existing code.

## Requirements
- Create Processor protocol for data transformation
- Create Enhancer protocol for data enhancement
- Implement protocols for common data types
- Support custom implementations by users
- Ensure protocol consolidation for performance
- Provide testing utilities for protocol implementations

## Design Decisions

### 1. Processor Protocol
- Transform input data for engine/plugin consumption
- Support multiple data type representations
- Enable format conversion between types
- Provide metadata extraction

### 2. Enhancer Protocol  
- Enhance data with additional context
- Support different enhancement strategies
- Enable chaining of enhancements
- Preserve original data integrity

### 3. Common Implementations
- Map: For structured data and configurations
- String: For text processing and manipulation
- List: For collections and batch operations
- Binary: For raw data handling
- Tuple: For fixed-size data structures

### 4. Extension Points
- Allow users to implement protocols for custom types
- Support domain-specific data structures
- Enable third-party integrations

## Implementation Plan

1. Define Processor protocol with core functions
2. Implement Processor for built-in types
3. Define Enhancer protocol
4. Implement enhancement strategies
5. Create protocol testing helpers
6. Add protocol consolidation configuration
7. Write comprehensive tests
8. Document protocol usage and examples

## Success Criteria
- Protocols work with all standard Elixir types
- Custom implementations are straightforward
- Performance is optimized through consolidation
- Clear documentation and examples
- Comprehensive test coverage
