# Feature 15.1.5: Reactor Workflow Integration

## Summary
Integrate the Reactor library to provide robust workflow orchestration for our Jido agent system. This feature leverages Reactor's mature DSL, dependency resolution, and compensation mechanisms to coordinate complex agent interactions and multi-step processes.

## Problem Statement
The agent system needs a way to orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple agents, with features like:
- Dependency resolution between workflow steps
- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Compensation and rollback on failures
- State persistence and resumability
- Comprehensive monitoring and debugging

Building a custom workflow engine would be time-consuming and error-prone. Reactor provides these capabilities out of the box.

## Solution Overview
Integrate Reactor as the workflow orchestration engine for our agent system:
1. Create Reactor-based workflow definitions that coordinate agent actions
2. Build a workflow coordinator that bridges Reactor and our agent system
3. Implement state persistence leveraging Reactor's built-in capabilities
4. Add comprehensive monitoring using Reactor's middleware system
5. Create a library of reusable workflow patterns for common agent interactions

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Reactor-based Workflows (15.1.5.1)
- Define workflow modules using `use Reactor`
- Create reusable step modules implementing `Reactor.Step` behaviour
- Design agent-specific workflow patterns (sequential, parallel, fan-out/fan-in)
- Integrate Jido agents as Reactor steps
- Implement workflow composition strategies

### Phase 2: Agent Workflow Coordinator (15.1.5.2)
- Create `RubberDuck.Jido.Agents.WorkflowCoordinator` as the main interface
- Integrate Reactor execution with our agent supervision system
- Pass agent state through Reactor context
- Add telemetry middleware for monitoring
- Translate between workflow events and agent signals

### Phase 3: Workflow Persistence (15.1.5.3)
- Leverage Reactor's state management for workflow persistence
- Add agent-specific state serialization
- Integrate checkpoints with agent lifecycle
- Implement workflow recovery mechanisms
- Version workflows for safe updates

### Phase 4: Workflow Monitoring (15.1.5.4)
- Use `Reactor.Middleware.Telemetry` for base metrics
- Create custom middleware for agent-specific metrics
- Integrate with existing telemetry system
- Build workflow visualization tools
- Add debugging features using Reactor's introspection

### Phase 5: Agent Workflow Library (15.1.5.5)
- Common patterns: MapReduce, Pipeline, Scatter-Gather
- Reusable steps: ExecuteAction, SendSignal, WaitForResponse
- Compensation strategies for agent failures
- Workflow composition helpers
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Key Components

### 1. Workflow Definitions
```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Workflows.DataProcessing do
  use Reactor
  
  input :data
  input :agent_pool
  
  # Scatter work across agents
  map :process_chunks do
    source input(:data)
    
    step :process_chunk, RubberDuck.Steps.ExecuteAgentAction do
      argument :chunk, element(:process_chunks)
      argument :agent_pool, input(:agent_pool)
      argument :action, value(ProcessChunkAction)
    end
  end
  
  # Gather results
  collect :results do
    argument :chunks, result(:process_chunks)
  end
  
  return :results
end
```

### 2. Agent Steps
```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Steps.ExecuteAgentAction do
  use Reactor.Step
  
  def run(arguments, context, _options) do
    agent = select_agent(arguments.agent_pool)
    
    case Agent.Server.execute_action(agent, arguments.action, arguments.chunk) do
      {:ok, result} -> {:ok, result}
      {:error, reason} -> {:error, reason}
    end
  end
  
  def compensate(_reason, _arguments, _context, _options) do
    :retry  # Let Reactor handle retries
  end
end
```

### 3. Workflow Coordinator
```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Jido.Agents.WorkflowCoordinator do
  use GenServer
  
  def execute_workflow(workflow_module, inputs, opts \\ []) do
    context = build_context(opts)
    
    case Reactor.run(workflow_module, inputs, context) do
      {:ok, result} -> {:ok, result}
      {:halted, state} -> handle_halted(state)
      {:error, errors} -> handle_errors(errors)
    end
  end
end
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual Reactor steps
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Test compensation and rollback scenarios
- Performance tests with concurrent workflows
- Fault injection to test error handling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Reactor workflows can coordinate multiple agent actions
- [ ] Workflows support parallel execution and dependency resolution
- [ ] Failed workflows can be compensated or resumed
- [ ] Comprehensive telemetry data is collected
- [ ] Common workflow patterns are documented and reusable

## Dependencies
- Reactor library (already in mix.exs)
- Existing agent system (15.1.4)
- Telemetry system (15.1.4.5)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Complexity of integrating two systems
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple workflows, incrementally add features
- **Risk**: Performance overhead of workflow orchestration
  - **Mitigation**: Use Reactor's async execution, profile bottlenecks
- **Risk**: Debugging complex workflows
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive logging, visualization tools

## Future Enhancements
- Visual workflow designer
- Workflow marketplace for sharing patterns
- Dynamic workflow modification
- Cross-system workflow orchestration
- Machine learning for workflow optimization
