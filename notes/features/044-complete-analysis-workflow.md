# Feature: Complete Analysis Workflow

## Summary
Create a comprehensive analysis workflow that combines all analysis engines (semantic, style, security) with LLM-powered insights to provide in-depth code analysis with prioritized issues and actionable fix suggestions.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create `RubberDuck.Workflows.CompleteAnalysis` module using existing workflow patterns
- [ ] Implement parallel analysis steps for efficiency
- [ ] Integrate all three analysis engines (Semantic, Style, Security)
- [ ] Add LLM-powered code review for additional insights
- [ ] Aggregate and prioritize results across all engines
- [ ] Generate actionable fix suggestions with confidence scores
- [ ] Build structured analysis report templates
- [ ] Support incremental analysis for large codebases
- [ ] Handle partial failures gracefully
- [ ] Track analysis metrics and performance

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Workflow patterns: Use Reactor-based workflow system with step definitions
- Analysis engines: All implement the Engine behavior with analyze/2 and analyze_source/3
- LLM Service: Available via RubberDuck.LLM.Service with request/response pattern

### Documentation Reviewed
- Workflow system: Uses Reactor framework with compensation support
- AST parsing workflow: Example of parallel file processing with error handling
- Analyzer module: Already orchestrates multiple engines with parallel execution
- LLM integration: Service supports multiple providers with fallback

### Existing Patterns Found
- Pattern 1: [lib/rubber_duck/workflows/ast_parsing_workflow.ex:23] - Workflow DSL usage
- Pattern 2: [lib/rubber_duck/workflows/workflow.ex:74] - Step definition with arguments
- Pattern 3: [lib/rubber_duck/analysis/analyzer.ex:186] - Parallel engine execution
- Pattern 4: [lib/rubber_duck/workflows/executor.ex:33] - Synchronous workflow execution

### Technical Approach
1. **Workflow Structure**:
   - Use the existing workflow DSL to define steps
   - Leverage Reactor.Step for each analysis phase
   - Implement compensation for rollback on failures

2. **Analysis Steps**:
   - `validate_input`: Validate file paths and options
   - `read_and_detect`: Read files and detect language
   - `parse_ast`: Parse AST using existing parser
   - `run_analysis_engines`: Execute all engines in parallel
   - `llm_review`: Add LLM-powered insights
   - `aggregate_results`: Combine and prioritize all findings
   - `generate_report`: Create structured report

3. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Reuse existing Analyzer.run_engines for engine orchestration
   - Add new LLM review step that uses context from analysis results
   - Build on existing aggregation logic in Analyzer
   - Create report templates using EEx for flexibility

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM API failures | High | Use circuit breaker, fallback to analysis-only mode |
| Large file processing | Medium | Implement streaming and chunking for large files |
| Memory usage with parallel execution | Medium | Configure max concurrency, use bounded queues |
| Inconsistent results across engines | Low | Normalize severity levels, deduplicate similar issues |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Add caching layer, support incremental analysis |

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should the LLM review be mandatory or optional (fallback to analysis-only)?
2. What format should the final report take (JSON, Markdown, both)?
3. Should we implement a severity threshold for LLM review (only review high/critical issues)?
4. Do you want real-time progress updates during analysis?
5. Should incremental analysis use file checksums or timestamps for change detection?
