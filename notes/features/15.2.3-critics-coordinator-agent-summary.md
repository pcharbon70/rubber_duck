# Feature Summary: Critics Coordinator Agent (15.2.3)

## Overview
Transform the existing Critics Orchestrator into a Jido Agent that coordinates validation critics through signal-based communication, enabling distributed validation of plans and tasks.

## Key Transformation Points

### From Orchestrator to Agent
- **Current**: Module with struct-based state management
- **New**: Jido Agent with signal-based coordination
- **Benefit**: Enables distributed critic execution and better fault tolerance

### Signal-Based Validation Flow
1. Receive `validate_target` signal with plan/task data
2. Discover and select appropriate critics
3. Distribute work via `critic_assigned` signals
4. Collect results asynchronously
5. Aggregate and emit `validation_complete` signal

### Core Features to Implement

1. **Critic Registry**
   - Dynamic registration/unregistration of critics
   - Capability-based discovery
   - Load balancing across instances

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Maintain existing parallel validation capability
   - Add timeout and retry mechanisms
   - Handle partial failures gracefully

3. **Result Aggregation**
   - Normalize results from different critics
   - Calculate overall severity and status
   - Generate actionable recommendations

4. **Caching Layer**
   - Cache validation results with TTL
   - Invalidate on target changes
   - Reduce redundant validations

5. **Performance Metrics**
   - Track critic response times
   - Monitor success/failure rates
   - Identify bottlenecks

## Technical Design

### Agent State Schema
```elixir
schema: [
  active_validations: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  critic_registry: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  cache: [type: :map, default: %{}],
  cache_enabled: [type: :boolean, default: true],
  parallel_execution: [type: :boolean, default: true],
  timeout: [type: :integer, default: 30_000]
]
```

### Signal Types
- **Input**: `validate_target`, `register_critic`, `unregister_critic`
- **Output**: `validation_started`, `critic_assigned`, `validation_complete`, `validation_failed`

### Integration Points
- Works with existing Critic modules (no changes required)
- Can coordinate both module-based and agent-based critics
- Integrates with Validation Ash resource for persistence

## Implementation Priority
1. Core agent structure and state management
2. Basic validation flow with existing critics
3. Critic registry and discovery
4. Parallel execution and result aggregation
5. Caching and performance metrics

## Expected Outcomes
- Distributed validation capability
- Better fault tolerance and retry handling
- Performance insights through metrics
- Maintainable signal-based architecture
- Foundation for future critic enhancements
