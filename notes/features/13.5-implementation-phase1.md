# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: Core FileManager Module

## Completed Tasks

### 1. FileManager Module Structure
- Created `RubberDuck.Projects.FileManager` module with comprehensive file management capabilities
- Implemented struct-based design with project/user context
- Added configurable options for file size limits, extensions, audit logging, and virus scanning

### 2. Authorization Integration
- Integrated with Ash policies through `Workspace.can?/3` function
- Supports owner and collaborator permissions (admin, write, read)
- All operations check authorization before execution

### 3. Core File Operations Implemented
- **read_file/3**: Secure file reading with streaming support
- **write_file/4**: Atomic writes using temporary files and rename
- **delete_file/3**: Soft delete with trash support or permanent deletion
- **create_directory/3**: Recursive directory creation
- **list_directory/3**: Paginated directory listing with sorting
- **move_file/4**: Atomic file/directory moving
- **copy_file/4**: Efficient file copying with progress tracking

### 4. Security Validations
- Path traversal prevention with ".." detection
- Path normalization and project boundary validation
- File size validation with configurable limits
- File extension validation (optional)
- All paths resolved within project sandbox

### 5. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error types defined
- Detailed error reasons for debugging
- Graceful handling of system errors
- Transaction-like behavior with atomic operations

### 6. Operation Logging
- All operations logged with user/project context
- Success/failure status tracking
- Metadata capture (file sizes, destinations, etc.)
- Foundation for audit trail implementation

### 7. Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite with 29 tests
- All tests passing
- Coverage includes:
  - Basic file operations
  - Security validations
  - Authorization checks
  - Edge cases and error scenarios
  - Pagination and sorting
  - Progress callbacks

## Key Implementation Details

### Atomic Operations
- Write operations use temporary files to ensure atomicity
- Moves and renames are atomic at the filesystem level
- Trash functionality provides recovery option

### Performance Considerations
- Streaming support for large files
- Pagination for directory listings
- Progress callbacks for long operations
- Efficient file copying with chunked reads

### Security Features
- Multiple layers of path validation
- Integration with existing authorization system
- Configurable security policies
- Audit logging capability

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Enhanced Operations
- Implement file metadata caching
- Add file watching integration
- Enhance trash/recycle bin with restoration
- Add batch operations support

### Phase 3: Security Features
- Implement virus scanning hooks
- Add encryption support
- Create comprehensive audit trail
- Add file integrity checking

### Phase 4: Search System
- Implement pattern-based file search
- Add content indexing
- Create search result ranking
- Add saved searches

### Phase 5: Collaboration
- Implement file locking mechanism
- Add conflict detection
- Create merge strategies
- Add real-time notifications

## Integration Points

The FileManager is ready to be integrated with:
- ProjectFilesLive for UI operations
- WatcherManager for file change notifications
- Future search and collaboration systems
- Audit and security systems

## Usage Example

```elixir
# Create a FileManager instance
fm = FileManager.new(project, user, 
  max_file_size: 10_000_000,  # 10MB
  allowed_extensions: [".ex", ".exs", ".md"],
  enable_audit: true
)

# Read a file
{:ok, content} = FileManager.read_file(fm, "lib/app.ex")

# Write a file atomically
{:ok, _} = FileManager.write_file(fm, "README.md", "# My Project")

# Copy with progress tracking
{:ok, _} = FileManager.copy_file(fm, "large_file.dat", "backup/large_file.dat",
  progress_callback: fn {:progress, percent} ->
    IO.puts("Progress: #{percent}%")
  end
)
```
