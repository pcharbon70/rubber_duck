- [ ] Implement comprehensive cost estimation for correction strategies (time, resources, risk)
- [ ] Add learning system that tracks strategy outcomes and improves selection accuracy
- [ ] Provide real-time strategy recommendations with confidence scoring
- [ ] Support A/B testing framework for strategy comparison and optimization
- [ ] Integration with Error Detection Agent for error analysis consumption
- [ ] Create metrics tracking for selection accuracy, cost prediction, and learning effectiveness
- [ ] Implement fallback chains and constraint checking for strategy validation

## Research Summary

### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- **Jido Agent Framework**: Must use BaseAgent pattern with signal-based communication, state schema validation, and proper error handling
- **Self-Correction Engine**: Existing strategy behavior patterns with analyze/4, priority/0, validate_correction/2 callbacks
- **Cost Calculator**: Token-based cost calculation patterns with provider-specific pricing and ROI analysis
- **Adaptive Selector**: ML-based selection with confidence scoring and historical performance tracking

### Documentation Reviewed
- **BaseAgent Pattern**: Signal-based architecture using CloudEvents, schema validation with NimbleOptions, health checks and lifecycle hooks
- **Self-Correction System**: Comprehensive learning system with effectiveness tracking and composite scoring algorithms
- **Token Manager**: Cost calculation infrastructure with multi-dimensional cost models and optimization recommendations
- **Error Detection Agent**: Recently implemented agent providing error classification with severity scoring and impact analysis

### Existing Patterns Found
- **Strategy Behavior**: `lib/rubber_duck/self_correction/strategy.ex:1` - Defines strategy interface with analysis, priority, and validation
- **Learning Engine**: `lib/rubber_duck/self_correction/learner.ex:15` - Implements effectiveness tracking and pattern recognition
- **Cost Calculator**: `lib/rubber_duck/agents/token_manager/cost_calculator.ex:25` - Provides cost estimation and ROI calculation patterns
- **Adaptive Selector**: `lib/rubber_duck/context/adaptive_selector.ex:40` - ML-based selection with confidence scoring and A/B testing
- **Error Detection**: `lib/rubber_duck/agents/error_detection_agent.ex:75` - Signal handlers for error analysis integration

### Technical Approach
1. **Agent Structure**: Create `CorrectionStrategyAgent` using BaseAgent with signal handlers for error detection integration and strategy selection workflows
2. **Strategy Library**: Implement comprehensive strategy registry with metadata (prerequisites, constraints, success rates, documentation)
3. **Cost Estimation**: Extend existing cost calculation patterns to support multi-dimensional correction costs (time, resources, risk, ROI)
4. **Selection Engine**: Multi-criteria decision algorithm using weighted scoring across effectiveness, cost, confidence, and constraint satisfaction
5. **Learning System**: Feedback-driven improvement with strategy effectiveness tracking, pattern recognition, and adaptive weight adjustment
6. **Integration**: Seamless communication with Error Detection Agent via signals (error_detection_result â†’ strategy_selection_result)

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Strategy Selection Accuracy | High | Multi-criteria evaluation with confidence intervals, validation against historical data |

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should the strategy library be persisted using Ash resources or in-memory with periodic snapshots?
2. What's the preferred approach for A/B testing - should it be enabled by default or opt-in per error type?
3. Should cost estimation include potential cascading effects of corrections (e.g., changes that might introduce new errors)?
4. Any specific machine learning approaches you'd prefer for the selection algorithm (decision trees, neural networks, ensemble methods)?
5. How should we handle cases where no strategy meets the minimum confidence threshold?
