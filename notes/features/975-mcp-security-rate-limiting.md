# Feature 9.7.5: MCP Security and Rate Limiting

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive security and rate limiting for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) transport layer. This feature adds multiple layers of security to protect the MCP endpoints from abuse, unauthorized access, and resource exhaustion attacks.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. **SecurityManager** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/security_manager.ex`)
- Central coordinator for all security operations
- Integrates authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and audit logging
- Provides unified interface for security checks
- Manages security contexts and sessions
- ~700 lines of comprehensive security logic

### 2. **RateLimiter** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/rate_limiter.ex`)
- Token bucket algorithm implementation
- Hierarchical rate limiting (global → client → operation)
- Support for burst allowances and priority clients
- Cost-based operations (different operations consume different tokens)
- ETS-based storage for high performance
- ~400 lines implementing flexible rate limiting

### 3. **AuditLogger** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/audit_logger.ex`)
- Comprehensive audit logging for all MCP operations
- Structured log format with consistent schema
- Automatic sensitive data redaction
- Log retention and rotation policies
- Real-time streaming for monitoring
- Query interface for analysis
- ~600 lines with full audit trail capabilities

### 4. **IPAccessControl** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/ip_access_control.ex`)
- IP whitelisting and blacklisting
- CIDR block and wildcard pattern support
- Temporary blocking for suspicious activity
- Automatic blocking after failure threshold
- Caching for performance
- ~450 lines of IP-based access control

### 5. **SessionManager** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/session_manager.ex`)
- Secure session creation and validation
- Token generation with Phoenix.Token
- Configurable session timeouts
- Session activity tracking
- Multi-session support per user
- Session revocation capabilities
- ~500 lines managing session lifecycle

## Integration Points

### MCPAuth Enhancement
- Updated to delegate authentication to SecurityManager
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing auth methods
- Adds IP address and user agent extraction
- Integrates security context into auth flow

### MCPChannel Security
- Added security checks to all MCP requests:
  - Request size validation
  - Rate limit enforcement
  - Operation authorization
  - Audit logging of all operations
- Security event reporting for anomalies
- Enhanced error responses with rate limit information

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Token-based authentication via Phoenix.Token
- API key support for external integrations
- Session-based authentication with timeout
- Multi-factor authentication hooks (extensible)

### Authorization
- Capability-based security model
- Role-based access control (admin, user, readonly)
- Tool-specific permissions
- Resource access control
- Operation-level authorization

### Rate Limiting
- Global rate limits across all clients
- Per-client configurable limits
- Per-operation cost modeling
- Priority client support (low, normal, high, critical)
- Adaptive rate limiting based on behavior
- Circuit breaker for consistently failing clients

### Monitoring & Compliance
- Complete audit trail of all operations
- Security event detection and alerting
- IP-based threat detection
- Session activity monitoring
- Configurable retention policies
- Export capabilities for compliance

## Configuration

The security system is highly configurable through the SecurityManager:

```elixir
%{
  authentication: %{
    token_expiry: 3600,
    refresh_enabled: true,
    multi_factor: false
  },
  rate_limiting: %{
    default_limit: 100,
    window_seconds: 60,
    burst_allowance: 20
  },
  authorization: %{
    default_role: "user",
    capability_checking: true,
    tool_permissions: true
  },
  request_limits: %{
    max_size: 1_048_576,  # 1MB
    max_params: 100
  },
  audit: %{
    enabled: true,
    retention_days: 90,
    sensitive_params: ["password", "token", "secret"]
  },
  monitoring: %{
    suspicious_threshold: 10,
    lockout_duration: 300  # 5 minutes
  }
}
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suites demonstrating:
- Rate limiter token bucket algorithm
- IP access control with patterns
- Whitelist/blacklist management
- Temporary blocking
- Auto-blocking on failures
- Cache behavior

## Performance Considerations

- ETS tables for high-performance storage
- Caching of access decisions
- Efficient pattern matching for IP rules
- Asynchronous audit logging
- Cleanup processes for expired data

## Security Benefits

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
2. **Resource Protection**: Rate limiting prevents DoS attacks and resource exhaustion
3. **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions ensure principle of least privilege
4. **Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring identifies suspicious patterns
5. **Compliance**: Complete audit trail supports regulatory requirements
6. **Flexibility**: Highly configurable to adapt to different security requirements

## Future Enhancements

- Geo-IP blocking integration
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- WebAuthn support for stronger authentication
- Integration with external SIEM systems
- Advanced threat intelligence feeds
- Distributed rate limiting for clustered deployments

## Usage Example

The security features are automatically applied to all MCP connections:

```elixir
# Client connects with credentials
params = %{
  "token" => "valid_token",
  "clientInfo" => %{
    "name" => "TestClient",
    "version" => "1.0.0"
  }
}

# SecurityManager handles:
# 1. Authentication via token
# 2. IP access check
# 3. Session creation
# 4. Capability assignment
# 5. Audit logging

# Each request is then:
# 1. Size validated
# 2. Rate limited
# 3. Authorized
# 4. Audited
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides enterprise-grade security for the MCP protocol, ensuring that RubberDuck can safely expose its tool system to external LLMs while maintaining control over access, preventing abuse, and meeting compliance requirements.
