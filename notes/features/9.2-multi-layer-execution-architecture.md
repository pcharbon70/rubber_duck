# Section 9.2: Multi-Layer Execution Architecture

## Overview

The Multi-Layer Execution Architecture provides a sophisticated, secure, and observable execution pipeline for tools in the RubberDuck system. This architecture implements multiple layers of validation, authorization, sandboxing, and monitoring to ensure safe and reliable tool execution.

   - Error handling and recovery

8. **RubberDuck.Tool.Monitoring** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/monitoring.ex`)
   - Real-time metrics collection
   - Execution history tracking
   - Health check system
   - Prometheus metrics export
   - Telemetry event handling

9. **RubberDuck.Tool.Monitoring.Dashboard** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/monitoring/dashboard.ex`)
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard
   - System overview and analytics
   - Performance trends visualization
   - Error analysis and reporting
   - WebSocket-based updates

10. **RubberDuck.Tool.Telemetry** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/telemetry.ex`)
    - Standardized telemetry events
    - Periodic system measurements
    - Integration with monitoring system

### DSL Extensions

Extended the tool DSL with new security options:

```elixir
tool do
  metadata do
    name :example_tool
    description "Example tool with security"
  end
  
  security do
    level :strict  # or :balanced, :relaxed, :none
    allowed_paths ["/tmp", "/workspace"]
    dangerous_functions [:File.rm_rf!, :System.cmd]
    max_file_size 10_485_760  # 10MB
  end
  
  execution do
    timeout 30_000
    retries 3
    handler fn params, context -> 
      # Tool implementation
    end
  end
end
```

### Execution Flow

1. **Parameter Validation**
   - JSON Schema validation
   - Custom constraint checks
   - Partial validation for progressive input

2. **Authorization**
   - Capability verification
   - Role-based access checks
   - Context-aware caching for performance

3. **Sandboxed Execution**
   - Process isolation with resource limits
   - Security constraint enforcement
   - Monitoring and violation detection

4. **Result Processing**
   - Output validation
   - Format transformation
   - Metadata enrichment
   - Caching and persistence

5. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Real-time metrics collection
   - Performance tracking
   - Error analysis
   - Health monitoring

## Key Design Decisions

### Single-Node Focus
- Optimized for single-node execution
- Process-level isolation instead of distributed sandboxing
- Local ETS caching and storage

### Process-Level Restrictions
- Erlang process flags for memory limits
- CPU monitoring through periodic checks
- File system access control via path validation

### Resource Limits
- Memory: Process heap size limits
- CPU: Time-based monitoring
- Disk: Path restrictions and file size limits
- Network: Not implemented (deferred)

### No Tool Composition
- Tools execute independently
- Composition deferred to later sections
- Focus on single-tool execution pipeline

### No Replay/Debugging
- Execution history for analytics only
- No replay functionality
- Debugging via monitoring and logs

## Testing Coverage

Created comprehensive test suites:

1. **Integration Tests** (`test/rubber_duck/tool/integration_test.exs`)
   - End-to-end execution pipeline
   - All layers working together
   - Real tool execution scenarios

2. **Security Tests** (`test/rubber_duck/tool/security_test.exs`)
   - Sandbox isolation verification
   - Resource limit enforcement
   - Security violation detection

3. **Performance Tests** (`test/rubber_duck/tool/performance_test.exs`)
   - Execution timing
   - Caching effectiveness
   - Concurrent execution handling

4. **Edge Case Tests** (`test/rubber_duck/tool/edge_cases_test.exs`)
   - Error handling
   - Timeout scenarios
   - Invalid input handling

## Monitoring Capabilities

The monitoring system provides:

- **Real-time Metrics**: Execution counts, success rates, performance
- **Health Checks**: Component status, resource usage, error rates
- **Historical Analytics**: Execution history, trends, patterns
- **Prometheus Export**: Standard metrics format for integration
- **Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring interface

## Security Features

- **Process Isolation**: Each execution in separate process
- **Resource Limits**: Memory, CPU, disk access controls
- **Path Validation**: Prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Function Restrictions**: Block dangerous operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete execution history

## Performance Optimizations

- **ETS Caching**: Fast in-memory caching
- **Authorization Cache**: Context-aware caching
- **Parallel Validation**: Concurrent constraint checks
- **Efficient Monitoring**: Low-overhead metrics collection

## Future Enhancements

While not implemented in this section, the architecture supports:

- Distributed execution (via GenServer distribution)
- Tool composition pipelines
- Advanced debugging capabilities
- Network resource limits
- Custom sandbox implementations

## Conclusion

The Multi-Layer Execution Architecture provides a robust foundation for secure tool execution in RubberDuck. The layered approach ensures defense in depth, while the monitoring system provides complete observability into the execution pipeline. The architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility.
