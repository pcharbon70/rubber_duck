# Feature: Unit Tests for Section 1.1

## Summary
Implement comprehensive unit tests for all components completed in section 1.1 of the implementation plan, including application startup, dependency verification, configuration loading, supervision tree structure, and telemetry.

## Requirements
- [ ] Test that application starts successfully (1.1.11)
- [ ] Test that required dependencies are available: Phoenix, Ash, Ecto (1.1.12)
- [ ] Test that configuration files are properly loaded (1.1.13)
- [ ] Test that supervision tree is correctly structured (1.1.14)
- [ ] Test that environment variables are properly read (1.1.15)
- [ ] Additional tests for telemetry implementation (1.1.5.6)
- [ ] Additional tests for pre-commit hooks functionality
- [ ] Additional tests for GitHub Actions workflows (where applicable)

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Ash Framework testing: Requires `config :ash, :disable_async?, true` in test config
- Ash Framework testing: Recommends `config :ash, :missed_notifications, :ignore`
- Elixir testing: Use ExUnit for unit tests
- OTP testing: Test supervision trees and application startup

### Documentation Reviewed
- Ash testing guide: Focus on testing resources, actions, and policies
- ExUnit documentation: Standard Elixir testing framework
- Hex.pm for test dependencies: No additional test dependencies needed

### Existing Patterns Found
- Basic test structure exists: test/rubber_duck_test.exs with simple test
- Test helper configured: test/test_helper.exs starts ExUnit
- Test configuration: config/test.exs has Ash async disabled

### Technical Approach
1. Create comprehensive test modules for each component:
   - Application startup tests in `test/rubber_duck/application_test.exs`
   - Configuration tests in `test/rubber_duck/config_test.exs`
   - Telemetry tests in `test/rubber_duck/telemetry_test.exs`
   - Pre-commit hook tests in `test/rubber_duck/git_hooks_test.exs`
   
2. Use ExUnit.Case for all test modules
3. Use Application.ensure_all_started/1 for dependency verification
4. Use System.get_env/1 for environment variable tests
5. Use Supervisor.which_children/1 for supervision tree tests
6. Mock external dependencies where needed

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| GitHub Actions tests can't run locally | Low | Create documentation-only tests or skip |
| Pre-commit hook tests may affect git state | Medium | Use temporary git repos for testing |
| Telemetry tests may have timing issues | Low | Use proper test synchronization |
| Environment variable tests may pollute test env | Low | Save and restore env vars in setup/teardown |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `test/rubber_duck/application_test.exs` with startup tests
- [ ] Create `test/rubber_duck/config_test.exs` with configuration tests
- [ ] Create `test/rubber_duck/telemetry_test.exs` with telemetry tests
- [ ] Create `test/rubber_duck/git_hooks_test.exs` with pre-commit tests
- [ ] Update `test/test_helper.exs` if needed for test setup
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with `mix test`
- [ ] Verify test coverage with `mix coveralls`
- [ ] Document any test utilities created

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we test the GitHub Actions workflows themselves, or just document that they exist?
2. Do you want integration tests for the full application startup, or just unit tests for individual components?
3. Should pre-commit hook tests actually run the hooks, or just verify they exist and are executable?
4. Do you want property-based tests using StreamData for any components?

## Log
- Created feature plan document with comprehensive test requirements
- Received approval to proceed with implementation
- Created feature branch: feature/1.1-unit-tests
- Implemented test files:
  - `test/rubber_duck/application_test.exs`: Tests for application startup, dependencies, and supervision tree
  - `test/rubber_duck/config_test.exs`: Tests for configuration loading and environment variables
  - `test/rubber_duck/telemetry_test.exs`: Tests for telemetry supervisor and measurements
  - `test/rubber_duck/git_hooks_test.exs`: Tests for pre-commit hook structure and content
- Updated main RubberDuck module to remove hello world function and add version/0
- Updated main test file to remove outdated tests
- Tests require database setup to run (PostgreSQL authentication needed)

## Final Implementation
### Tests Created
1. **Application Tests** (`test/rubber_duck/application_test.exs`):
   - Application startup verification
   - Dependency availability checks (Ash, Ecto, Phoenix PubSub, AshPostgres)
   - Supervision tree structure validation
   - Supervisor strategy verification

2. **Configuration Tests** (`test/rubber_duck/config_test.exs`):
   - Configuration file loading verification
   - Environment-specific configuration checks
   - Telemetry configuration validation
   - Environment variable reading tests
   - Database URL configuration support

3. **Telemetry Tests** (`test/rubber_duck/telemetry_test.exs`):
   - Telemetry supervisor startup
   - Child process verification (console reporter, telemetry poller)
   - Metrics definition validation
   - VM measurement dispatch tests
   - Run queue measurement tests
   - Ash telemetry handler verification

4. **Git Hooks Tests** (`test/rubber_duck/git_hooks_test.exs`):
   - Directory and file structure verification
   - Pre-commit hook executable status
   - Install script verification
   - Hook content validation (format, compile, credo checks)
   - Staged files check verification

### Code Updates
- Refactored `lib/rubber_duck.ex` to provide proper module documentation and version/0 function
- Updated test configuration to use environment variables for database credentials
- All tests follow ExUnit best practices and Ash testing guidelines

### Deviations from Plan
- Tests require database connection to run due to Ash setup requirements
- Added flexibility for database credentials via environment variables
- Skipped functional git hook tests to avoid complexity with temporary git repos

### Follow-up Tasks
1. Configure database credentials for CI/CD environment
2. Add database setup instructions to README
3. Consider adding property-based tests for complex domain logic
4. Add integration tests once core domain models are implemented
