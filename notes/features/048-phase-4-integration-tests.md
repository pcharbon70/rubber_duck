# Feature: Phase 4 Integration Tests

## Overview
Implement comprehensive integration tests for Phase 4 to verify that all workflow orchestration and analysis components work together correctly. These tests will validate the complete functionality of Reactor workflows, AST parsing, code analysis engines, agentic systems, dynamic workflow generation, and the hybrid architecture.

## Goals
- Verify end-to-end workflow execution across all Phase 4 components
- Test integration between engines and workflows via the hybrid architecture
- Validate multi-agent collaboration scenarios
- Ensure performance meets requirements under realistic loads
- Test complex orchestration patterns with real-world use cases

## Non-Goals
- Unit testing individual components (already covered)
- Testing Phase 5/6 functionality (not yet implemented)
- Performance benchmarking (separate concern)
- Testing external integrations (LLM providers, etc.)

## Technical Approach
1. Create integration test suite that exercises complete Phase 4 functionality
2. Test real-world scenarios combining multiple components
3. Validate cross-component communication and data flow
4. Ensure fault tolerance and error handling across boundaries
5. Test resource management and optimization strategies

## Requirements
- All Phase 4 components must be tested in integration
- Tests must use realistic project structures and code samples
- Multi-agent scenarios must demonstrate coordination
- Dynamic workflow generation must adapt to different inputs
- Hybrid architecture must seamlessly bridge engines and workflows

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup
1. Create integration test helpers and utilities
2. Set up test project structures with sample code
3. Create mock LLM service for predictable testing
4. Build test data generators for various scenarios

### Phase 2: Core Workflow Integration Tests
1. Test complete project analysis workflow
2. Test incremental analysis on file changes
3. Test custom workflow composition
4. Test parallel analysis performance
5. Test analysis caching effectiveness

### Phase 3: Cross-Component Integration Tests
1. Test AST parser with analysis engines
2. Test analysis results aggregation
3. Test workflow error handling and recovery
4. Test cross-file dependency analysis
5. Test multi-language project handling

### Phase 4: Agent Integration Tests
1. Test agent-based task execution
2. Test multi-agent collaboration
3. Test agent failure recovery
4. Test complex multi-agent scenarios
5. Test agent resource allocation

### Phase 5: Dynamic and Hybrid Tests
1. Test dynamic workflow generation
2. Test hybrid architecture performance
3. Test workflow optimization effectiveness
4. Test engine-workflow interoperability
5. Test capability-based routing

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Integration tests may be slow
  - **Mitigation**: Use test mode optimizations, parallel test execution
- **Risk**: Complex test setup may be brittle
  - **Mitigation**: Create robust test fixtures and helpers
- **Risk**: Flaky tests due to concurrency
  - **Mitigation**: Proper synchronization and deterministic test design

## Success Metrics
- All integration tests pass consistently
- Test coverage includes all major Phase 4 workflows
- Tests complete within reasonable time (< 5 minutes)
- No flaky tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Clear error messages for debugging failures

## Dependencies
- All Phase 4 components must be implemented
- Test infrastructure from previous phases
- Mock/stub implementations for external services

## Notes
- Focus on testing realistic scenarios over edge cases
- Ensure tests are maintainable and well-documented
- Consider test execution time in CI/CD pipeline
- Tests should help catch regressions during future development
