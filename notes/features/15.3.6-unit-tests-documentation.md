# Unit Tests for Conversation Agents (15.3.6)

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test suite for the conversation agent system implemented in section 15.3. The tests ensure proper functionality, integration, and quality of all conversation agents.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Routing Accuracy Tests

Tests for `ConversationRouterAgent` to ensure queries are routed to the correct specialized agents:

- **Planning Query Routing**: Verifies that planning-related queries are correctly identified and routed to the planning conversation agent
- **Analysis Query Routing**: Ensures code analysis requests are properly routed to the analysis agent
- **General Query Routing**: Confirms simple/general queries are handled by the appropriate agent

### 2. Conversation Handling Tests

Tests for proper conversation flow and state management:

- **Planning Conversation Flow**: Tests the multi-phase planning conversation flow from initial query through plan creation and improvement
- **Context Switching**: Verifies that `GeneralConversationAgent` properly handles context switches with history preservation
- **Feedback Loop**: Ensures `EnhancementConversationAgent` correctly processes and tracks user feedback

### 3. Context Preservation Tests

Verifies that conversation context is maintained across interactions:

- **Cross-Interaction Context**: Tests that context from initial conversations is preserved in subsequent interactions
- **Phase-Based Context**: Ensures planning context flows properly through different conversation phases
- **Context Stack Management**: Verifies proper context history management during switches

### 4. Analysis Integration Tests

Tests the integration between conversation agents and analysis functionality:

- **Analysis Request Flow**: Verifies that code analysis requests from conversations are properly queued and processed
- **Enhancement Triggering**: Tests that analysis results can trigger enhancement suggestions

### 5. Enhancement Quality Tests

Ensures enhancement suggestions maintain quality standards:

- **Suggestion Ranking**: Verifies that suggestions are properly ranked by impact
- **Metrics Tracking**: Tests that enhancement metrics accurately track improvement over time
- **Feedback Integration**: Ensures user feedback properly updates enhancement effectiveness scores

### 6. Inter-Agent Communication Tests

Tests the communication and handoff between agents:

- **Router Handoff**: Verifies the router can properly hand off specialized queries
- **General Agent Handoff**: Tests that the general agent can request handoff for queries requiring specialization

## Test Structure

### Integration Test Suite

Located in `/test/integration/conversation_agents_test.exs`, the test suite includes:

1. **SignalCollector Module**: A helper GenServer to capture emitted signals for verification
2. **Setup/Teardown**: Proper initialization and cleanup of test environments
3. **Comprehensive Test Cases**: Coverage of all major functionality areas

### Individual Agent Tests

Each agent has its own test file:

- `/test/rubber_duck/agents/conversation_router_agent_test.exs`
- `/test/rubber_duck/agents/planning_conversation_agent_test.exs`
- `/test/rubber_duck/agents/code_analysis_agent_test.exs`
- `/test/rubber_duck/agents/enhancement_conversation_agent_test.exs`
- `/test/rubber_duck/agents/general_conversation_agent_test.exs`

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. End-to-End Conversation Flow
- User asks a planning question
- Router identifies it as planning-related
- Routes to PlanningConversationAgent
- Agent maintains conversation state through phases
- Results are properly formatted and returned

### 2. Complex Enhancement Workflow
- Code analysis identifies issues
- Enhancement agent receives analysis results
- Generates ranked suggestions
- User provides feedback
- System learns from feedback for future enhancements

### 3. Context-Aware Conversations
- Initial conversation establishes context
- Subsequent queries maintain context
- Context switches are handled smoothly
- History is preserved when requested

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery
- Agents handle missing data gracefully
- Invalid signals don't crash the system
- Timeouts are properly managed
- Error states are communicated clearly

## Test Execution

### Running All Tests
```bash
mix test
```

### Running Integration Tests Only
```bash
mix test test/integration/
```

### Running Specific Agent Tests
```bash
mix test test/rubber_duck/agents/conversation_router_agent_test.exs
```

## Coverage Metrics

The test suite aims for:
- **Unit Test Coverage**: >90% for core agent functionality
- **Integration Coverage**: All major interaction paths tested
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Common error scenarios handled
- **Performance**: Tests include basic performance assertions

## Future Improvements

1. **Load Testing**: Add tests for high-volume concurrent conversations
2. **Stress Testing**: Test behavior under resource constraints
3. **Chaos Testing**: Introduce random failures to test resilience
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add detailed performance measurement
5. **Property-Based Testing**: Use PropCheck for comprehensive input testing

## Conclusion

The comprehensive test suite ensures that the conversation agent system is:
- Reliable and stable
- Properly integrated
- Maintaining quality standards
- Ready for production use

All five main test categories (routing accuracy, conversation handling, context preservation, analysis integration, and enhancement quality) have been thoroughly covered.
