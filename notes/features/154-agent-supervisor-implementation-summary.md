# Feature 15.1.4.1: Main Agent Supervisor - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the core agent supervisor architecture for managing Jido agents with fault tolerance, dynamic lifecycle management, and graceful shutdown coordination.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Main Supervisor (`RubberDuck.Jido.Agents.Supervisor`)
- **Features**:
  - Configurable supervision strategies (one_for_one, rest_for_one, one_for_all)
  - Dynamic agent spawning through DynamicSupervisor
  - Restart policies with configurable intensity
  - Agent lifecycle management (start, stop, list, get)
  - Rolling restart capabilities
  - Statistics and monitoring

- **Key Methods**:
  - `start_agent/3` - Starts agents with custom IDs and metadata
  - `stop_agent/1` - Graceful agent termination
  - `list_agents/0` - Lists all running agents
  - `rolling_restart/2` - Performs rolling restarts with configurable batching
  - `stats/0` - Provides supervision tree statistics

### 2. Agent Server (`RubberDuck.Jido.Agents.Server`)
- **Purpose**: GenServer wrapper that holds Jido agent state
- **Features**:
  - Wraps Jido agents (data structures) as supervised processes
  - Handles action execution through plan/run cycle
  - State updates and validation
  - Signal routing support
  - Health check integration
  - Telemetry events for monitoring

- **Key Methods**:
  - `execute_action/3` - Plans and runs actions on the agent
  - `update_state/2` - Updates agent state with validation
  - `send_signal/2` - Async signal delivery
  - `health_check/1` - Agent health status

### 3. Restart Tracker (`RubberDuck.Jido.Agents.RestartTracker`)
- **Purpose**: Prevents restart storms through exponential backoff
- **Features**:
  - Tracks restart history per agent
  - Exponential backoff calculation (1s initial, 60s max)
  - Configurable restart window (5 minutes default)
  - Maximum restarts threshold (5 in window)
  - ETS-based storage for performance
  - Automatic history cleanup

- **Configuration**:
  ```elixir
  initial_backoff: 1000ms
  max_backoff: 60_000ms
  backoff_multiplier: 2
  history_window: 300_000ms (5 min)
  max_restarts_in_window: 5
  ```

### 4. Shutdown Coordinator (`RubberDuck.Jido.Agents.ShutdownCoordinator`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinates graceful agent shutdown
- **Features**:
  - Multi-phase shutdown (draining â†’ saving â†’ terminating)
  - Configurable shutdown timeouts
  - State persistence hooks
  - Force shutdown fallback
  - Shutdown status tracking
  - Cancellable shutdown requests

- **Shutdown Phases**:
  1. **Draining**: Agent stops accepting new work
  2. **Saving**: Agent state is persisted
  3. **Terminating**: Process is terminated
  4. **Forced**: Immediate termination on timeout

## Integration Points

### With Jido Framework
- Agents are Jido data structures, not processes
- Server wraps agents for process-based supervision
- Uses Jido.Agent API (new/0, set/2, plan/3, run/1)
- Maintains schema validation through Jido

### With OTP
- Uses Supervisor and DynamicSupervisor behaviors
- Registry for process discovery
- ETS for high-performance lookups
- Telemetry for observability

## Test Coverage
- 18 tests written, 12 passing
- Covers:
  - Basic supervisor lifecycle
  - Agent start/stop operations
  - Restart tracking and backoff
  - Graceful shutdown coordination
  - Rolling restart functionality
  - Statistics and monitoring

## Phase 2: Agent Registry (15.1.4.2) - COMPLETED

### 5. Agent Registry (`RubberDuck.Jido.Agents.Registry`)
- **Purpose**: Fast agent discovery and metadata management
- **Features**:
  - ETS-based registry with high-performance lookups
  - Automatic registration/deregistration on agent lifecycle
  - Tag-based and capability-based discovery
  - Load-based agent selection
  - Query API for complex criteria matching
  - Process monitoring for automatic cleanup
  - Node-aware for distributed systems

- **Key Methods**:
  - `register/3` - Register agent with metadata
  - `find_by_tag/1` - Find agents by tag
  - `find_by_capability/1` - Find agents by capability
  - `get_least_loaded/1` - Get agent with lowest load
  - `query/1` - Complex criteria matching

### Integration Updates
- Supervisor automatically registers agents on start
- Supervisor unregisters agents on stop
- Agent Server reports load metrics to Registry
- Supervisor delegates discovery methods to Registry

## Known Limitations
1. Health monitoring system pending (Phase 15.1.4.4)  
2. Pool management not implemented (Phase 15.1.4.3)
3. Some integration tests failing due to missing dependencies

## Migration Notes
- Existing agents using BaseAgent work without modification
- ProcessRegistry must be started in application supervision tree
- ETS table for restart policies created automatically

## Next Steps
1. Implement Agent Registry (15.1.4.2) for better agent discovery
2. Add Pool Management (15.1.4.3) for resource optimization
3. Build Health Monitoring (15.1.4.4) for proactive issue detection
4. Add Lifecycle Telemetry (15.1.4.5) for complete observability

## Code Examples

### Basic Agent Management
```elixir
# Start the supervisor
{:ok, _} = RubberDuck.Jido.Agents.Supervisor.start_link()

# Start an agent with tags and capabilities
{:ok, pid} = Supervisor.start_agent(MyAgent, %{initial: "state"},
  id: "my_agent_123",
  restart: :permanent,
  tags: [:worker, :compute],
  capabilities: [:process_data],
  metadata: %{owner: "system"}
)

# Execute an action
{:ok, result} = Server.execute_action(pid, MyAction, %{param: "value"})

# Graceful shutdown
:ok = Supervisor.stop_agent("my_agent_123")
```

### Agent Discovery and Load Balancing
```elixir
# Find agents by tag
workers = Supervisor.find_by_tag(:worker)

# Find agents by capability
processors = Supervisor.find_by_capability(:process_data)

# Get least loaded worker
{:ok, agent} = Supervisor.get_least_loaded(:worker)
{:ok, result} = Server.execute_action(agent.pid, ProcessAction, data)

# Query with multiple criteria
agents = Supervisor.query(%{
  module: MyAgent,
  tags: :compute,
  capabilities: :gpu_acceleration
})

# Get statistics
stats = Supervisor.stats()
# => %{
#   total_agents: 5,
#   active_agents: 5, 
#   agents_by_module: %{MyAgent => 3, OtherAgent => 2},
#   restart_stats: %{...}
# }
```
