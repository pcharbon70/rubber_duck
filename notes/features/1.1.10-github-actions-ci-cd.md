# Feature: GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

## Summary
Configure comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment, including automated testing, code quality checks, and security scanning for the RubberDuck Elixir/Ash project.

## Requirements
- [ ] Basic CI workflow that runs on push and PR to main branch
- [ ] PostgreSQL service container for tests requiring database
- [ ] Dependency caching for faster builds
- [ ] Run all tests with proper Ash setup
- [ ] Format checking with `mix format --check-formatted`
- [ ] Compilation with warnings as errors
- [ ] Static code analysis with Credo (if added)
- [ ] Security audit with `mix hex.audit`
- [ ] Support for matrix testing (multiple Elixir/OTP versions)
- [ ] Separate workflows for different concerns (CI, security, quality)

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- No existing CI/CD usage rules found in the project
- Ash framework uses `mix ash.setup` for test preparation

### Documentation Reviewed
- GitHub Actions official documentation for Elixir setup
- erlef/setup-beam is the recommended action (replacing actions/setup-elixir)
- Best practices suggest caching deps/, _build/, and PLT files
- Matrix testing recommended for library compatibility

### Existing Patterns Found
- Test alias in mix.exs: ["ash.setup --quiet", "test"]
- PostgreSQL configuration in config/test.exs
- Elixir version requirement: ~> 1.18
- Test database uses MIX_TEST_PARTITION for parallel testing

### Technical Approach
1. Create main CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) with:
   - PostgreSQL service container
   - Dependency caching with hash of mix.lock
   - Format checking, compilation, and test running
   - Use erlef/setup-beam@v1 for Elixir/OTP setup

2. Create quality workflow (.github/workflows/quality.yml) for:
   - Credo analysis (if dependency added)
   - Unused dependency checking
   - Documentation building verification

3. Create security workflow (.github/workflows/security.yml) for:
   - mix hex.audit for vulnerability scanning
   - mix deps.audit if available
   - Dependency license checking

4. Implement smart caching strategy:
   - Cache key based on OS, OTP version, Elixir version, and mix.lock hash
   - Separate caches for deps and _build
   - PLT cache for dialyzer (if added later)

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Slow CI builds | Medium | Implement comprehensive caching strategy |
| PostgreSQL connection issues | High | Use proper health checks and wait strategy |
| Cache invalidation problems | Low | Use content-based cache keys |
| Workflow maintenance burden | Medium | Keep workflows simple and well-documented |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create .github/workflows directory structure
- [ ] Implement ci.yml workflow with test suite
- [ ] Add quality.yml workflow for code quality checks
- [ ] Add security.yml workflow for vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Configure dependency caching
- [ ] Add workflow documentation to README
- [ ] Test workflows with intentional failures
- [ ] Verify all checks pass on clean commit

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we add Credo and Dialyxir as dev dependencies now for static analysis?
   - **Decision**: Add Credo only, not Dialyxir
2. Do you want to enforce specific Elixir/OTP versions or test against multiple versions?
   - **Decision**: Matrix testing for Elixir 1.18+ with compatible OTP versions
3. Should we add coverage reporting (using excoveralls)?
   - **Decision**: Yes, add test coverage reporting
4. Do you want automatic deployment workflows for any environments?
   - **Decision**: Yes, setup deployment workflows
5. Should we add badge displays to the README for build status?
   - **Decision**: Yes, add badges to README
