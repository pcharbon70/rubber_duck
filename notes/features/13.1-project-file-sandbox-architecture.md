# Feature: Project Resource Enhancement & Security Architecture

## Summary
Enhance the existing Project resource with file sandbox capabilities and implement a comprehensive security architecture for project-based file system access with multi-user collaboration support.

## Requirements
- [ ] Add root_path, sandbox_config, file_access_enabled, max_file_size, and allowed_extensions attributes to Project resource
- [ ] Create ProjectFileAccess module for secure path validation and normalization
- [ ] Implement SymlinkSecurity module to detect and prevent symbolic link attacks
- [ ] Add project collaborator relationship with read/write permissions
- [ ] Create security audit tools for project file access monitoring
- [ ] Ensure all file operations remain within project boundaries
- [ ] Support multi-user access with proper authorization
- [ ] Integrate with existing Ash patterns and security practices

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Ash usage rules: Use declarative resource modeling, implement business logic in actions, use code interfaces on domains
- Security patterns: Existing path validation in Instructions.Security and Tool.Security.Sanitizer modules

### Documentation Reviewed
- Ash Framework: Resources, relationships, actions, policies
- Elixir Path module: safe_relative/1, expand/1 for path normalization
- File system security: Path traversal prevention, symbolic link detection

### Existing Patterns Found
- Project resource: lib/rubber_duck/workspace/project.ex - basic structure with name, description, configuration
- Security validation: lib/rubber_duck/instructions/security.ex:75 - validate_path/2 for path traversal prevention
- Path sanitization: lib/rubber_duck/tool/security/sanitizer.ex:103 - sanitize_path/1 with regex patterns
- User relationships: Multiple resources use belongs_to :user pattern (prompts, conversations, api_keys)
- File watching: lib/rubber_duck/instructions/cache_invalidator.ex - FileSystem integration for monitoring

### Technical Approach
1. **Enhance Project Resource**:
   - Add new attributes using Ash attribute declarations
   - Add owner relationship (belongs_to :user)
   - Create project_collaborators join table resource
   - Implement validation changes for root_path

2. **Create Security Modules**:
   - RubberDuck.Projects.FileAccess - centralized path validation
   - RubberDuck.Projects.SymlinkSecurity - symlink detection and prevention
   - Follow existing security patterns from Instructions and Tool modules

3. **Implement Authorization**:
   - Use Ash policies for project access control
   - Create custom checks for owner/collaborator permissions
   - Integrate with existing user authentication

4. **Security Audit Tools**:
   - Create Ash resource for audit logs
   - Use telemetry for file operation tracking
   - Build reporting queries using Ash

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Path traversal attacks | High | Use Path.safe_relative/1 and validate against project root |
| Symbolic link escapes | High | Implement lstat checks and resolve all symlinks |
| Performance with many file operations | Medium | Use ETS caching and batch operations |
| Breaking existing Project usage | Medium | Make new attributes optional with defaults |
| Complex permission management | Low | Start with simple owner/collaborator model |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Update lib/rubber_duck/workspace/project.ex with new attributes
- [ ] Create lib/rubber_duck/workspace/project_collaborator.ex resource
- [ ] Create lib/rubber_duck/projects/file_access.ex module
- [ ] Create lib/rubber_duck/projects/symlink_security.ex module
- [ ] Add project authorization policies
- [ ] Create lib/rubber_duck/projects/security_audit.ex resource
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all security functions
- [ ] Update RubberDuck.Workspace domain with new resources
- [ ] Add database migrations for new attributes and tables
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing Project functionality

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should project root_path be required or optional? (affects existing projects)
2. Do we need more granular permissions beyond read/write for collaborators?
3. Should we enforce allowed_extensions at the database level or application level?
4. Do we want to support nested project structures (projects within projects)?
5. Should security audit logs be kept indefinitely or have retention policies?
