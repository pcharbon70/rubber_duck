# Feature 15.2.1: Plan Manager Agent

## Overview

The Plan Manager Agent is a specialized Jido agent responsible for managing the lifecycle of development plans within the RubberDuck system. This agent serves as the central coordinator for creating, tracking, modifying, and querying plans that guide the AI-assisted development process.

## Purpose

The Plan Manager Agent addresses the need for structured plan management in AI-driven development workflows by:

1. **Centralized Plan Management**: Providing a single point of control for all plan-related operations
2. **State Consistency**: Ensuring plans maintain consistent state throughout their lifecycle
3. **Concurrent Access Control**: Managing multiple simultaneous plan operations safely
4. **Query Capabilities**: Enabling efficient search and retrieval of plans based on various criteria
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking metrics to optimize plan execution and resource usage

## Architecture

### Agent Structure
```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Agents.PlanManagerAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "plan_manager",
    description: "Manages development plan lifecycle and state",
    category: :planning,
    tags: [:plan_management, :coordination, :persistence],
    vsn: "1.0.0",
    schema: [
      plans: [type: {:map, :string, :map}, default: %{}],
      active_plans: [type: {:list, :string}, default: []],
      metrics: [type: :map, default: %{}],
      locks: [type: {:map, :string, :pid}, default: %{}]
    ]
end
```

### Core Components

1. **Plan Lifecycle Management**
   - Creation, validation, and initialization
   - State transitions (draft → active → completed/failed)
   - Automatic cleanup and archival
   - Version control and history tracking

2. **Workflow Integration**
   - Reactor workflow coordination
   - Signal-based communication
   - Event-driven state updates
   - Rollback and recovery mechanisms

3. **State Management System**
   - In-memory state cache
   - Persistence layer integration
   - Concurrency control with locking
   - Conflict resolution strategies

4. **Query Interface**
   - Flexible search capabilities
   - Filter by status, tags, date ranges
   - Aggregation and statistics
   - Paginated results with caching

5. **Metrics Collection**
   - Real-time performance tracking
   - Success/failure rates
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Trend analysis and reporting

## Signal Interface

### Input Signals
```elixir
# Plan creation
{:create_plan, %{
  name: String.t(),
  description: String.t(),
  phases: list(map()),
  metadata: map()
}}

# Plan updates
{:update_plan, %{
  plan_id: String.t(),
  updates: map()
}}

# State transitions
{:transition_plan, %{
  plan_id: String.t(),
  to_state: atom()
}}

# Queries
{:query_plans, %{
  filters: map(),
  pagination: map()
}}
```

### Output Signals
```elixir
# Plan events
{:plan_created, %{plan_id: String.t(), plan: map()}}
{:plan_updated, %{plan_id: String.t(), changes: map()}}
{:plan_transitioned, %{plan_id: String.t(), from: atom(), to: atom()}}

# Query results
{:plans_found, %{plans: list(map()), total: integer(), page: integer()}}

# Metrics
{:metrics_updated, %{metrics: map(), timestamp: DateTime.t()}}
```
