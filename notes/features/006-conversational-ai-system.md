# Feature: Conversational AI System

## Summary
Implement a comprehensive conversational AI system that enables multi-turn conversations, context-aware responses, and intelligent conversation management. This builds on the existing Dynamic LLM Configuration and chat-focused TUI to provide sophisticated AI interactions with persistent conversation history and context awareness.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create Ash-based Conversation domain with resources for conversations, messages, and context
- [ ] Implement ConversationContext for managing multi-turn conversation state
- [ ] Add conversation-aware command processing through unified command system
- [ ] Support conversation history persistence and retrieval
- [ ] Implement context-aware response generation with memory management
- [ ] Add conversation branching and merging capabilities
- [ ] Support conversation export and import functionality
- [ ] Integrate with existing LLM provider system for context-aware responses
- [ ] Update TUI and CLI interfaces to use conversational system
- [ ] Add conversation analytics and insights

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Ash Framework: Use domains, resources, code interfaces; avoid direct Ecto
- Elixir/OTP: GenServer patterns, tagged tuples, proper error handling
- Dynamic LLM Configuration: Runtime provider/model switching capabilities

### Documentation Reviewed
- Current chat-focused TUI implementation in `tui/internal/ui/chat.go`
- Dynamic LLM Configuration system in `lib/rubber_duck/llm/config.ex`
- Unified command system in `lib/rubber_duck/commands/`
- Existing domains in `lib/rubber_duck/` (workspace, llm, commands)

### Existing Patterns Found
- Pattern 1: Ash domains follow structure like `RubberDuck.Workspace` with resources and code interface
- Pattern 2: Chat messages in TUI have type, author, content, timestamp structure
- Pattern 3: Commands use Context struct for execution context and metadata
- Pattern 4: LLM providers selected dynamically through Config module
- Pattern 5: WebSocket channels maintain session state for real-time communication

### Technical Approach
1. **Create Conversation Domain**
   - `RubberDuck.Conversations` domain following Ash patterns
   - `Conversation` resource with user association and metadata
   - `Message` resource with role (user/assistant/system), content, timestamps
   - `ConversationContext` resource for managing conversation state and memory

2. **Conversation Management System**
   - ConversationManager GenServer for active conversation state
   - Context-aware message processing with conversation history
   - Integration with existing Command system for conversation-aware commands
   - Memory management for large conversations

3. **Enhanced Command Processing**
   - Extend unified command system to be conversation-aware
   - Pass conversation context to LLM providers
   - Support conversation-specific commands (clear, branch, export, etc.)
   - Maintain conversation flow through command execution

4. **Interface Integration**
   - Update TUI chat component to use conversation system
   - Enhance CLI client for conversation management
   - WebSocket channels for real-time conversation updates
   - Phoenix LiveView integration (future Phase 5.4)

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Memory usage with long conversations | High | Implement conversation summarization and context pruning |
| Database performance with large message history | Medium | Add proper indexing and pagination for message retrieval |
| Context token limits with LLM providers | High | Implement intelligent context windowing and summarization |
| Conversation state synchronization across interfaces | Medium | Use Phoenix PubSub for real-time conversation updates |
| Migration complexity for existing chat data | Low | Implement data migration scripts and backward compatibility |

- [ ] Update user interfaces:
  - [ ] Enhance TUI chat component with conversation features
  - [ ] Update CLI client for conversation management
  - [ ] WebSocket channel integration for real-time conversation
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage:

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should conversations be scoped per project/workspace, or global per user?
2. What conversation context window size should we target for different LLM providers?
3. Do we need conversation sharing/collaboration features between users?
4. Should we implement conversation templates or conversation types (coding, planning, etc.)?
5. What conversation analytics would be most valuable (token usage, response times, etc.)?

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Core conversational AI system successfully implemented and integrated

### Key Features Implemented

   - Database migration with proper indexing and constraints

2. **Command Integration** (`lib/rubber_duck/commands/handlers/conversation.ex`):
   - Conversation commands: start, list, show, send, delete
   - Integrated with unified command system and processor
   - Support for different conversation types (coding, debugging, planning, review)
   - Dynamic LLM preferences per conversation type

## Technical Architecture

### Conversation Flow
```
User Input → Commands.Parser → Commands.Processor → Conversation.Handler
    ↓
ConversationManager → LLM.Service (with context) → Response
    ↓
Message.create → ConversationContext.update → Response Formatting
```

### Database Relationships
```
User (1) → (n) Conversations (1) → (1) ConversationContext
                     ↓
                (1) → (n) Messages
```

### LLM Integration
- Dynamic model selection based on conversation type
