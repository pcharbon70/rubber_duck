- [ ] Implement performance monitoring and adaptation

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Reactor workflow patterns for dynamic step creation
- Agent system for resource availability
- Memory system for pattern recognition
- Ash Framework for workflow metadata

### Documentation Reviewed
- Reactor.Builder for programmatic workflow construction
- Agent capabilities and resource tracking
- Workflow execution patterns from section 4.1
- Agent coordination from section 4.5

### Existing Patterns Found

### Technical Approach
1. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Analyze task type, size, and dependencies
   - Estimate computational requirements
   - Identify required agent capabilities
   - Determine optimal parallelization strategy

2. **Workflow Template System**:
   - Create reusable workflow patterns
   - Support template composition
   - Enable parameter injection
   - Allow conditional step inclusion

3. **Dynamic Builder**:
   - Use Reactor.Builder API for runtime construction
   - Support incremental workflow building
   - Enable workflow modification during execution
   - Implement rollback capabilities

4. **Resource Management**:
   - Track available agents and their capabilities
   - Monitor system resources (CPU, memory)
   - Implement resource reservation
   - Support priority-based allocation

5. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - Cost-based optimization (time vs resources)
   - Historical performance data
   - Machine learning for pattern recognition
   - Adaptive strategy selection

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### 1. Complexity Analyzer
The `ComplexityAnalyzer` will examine incoming tasks and determine:
- **Task Classification**: Identify task type (analysis, generation, refactoring, etc.)
- **Size Estimation**: Calculate code size, dependency count, complexity metrics
- **Resource Requirements**: Estimate CPU, memory, and agent needs
- **Parallelization Potential**: Identify independent subtasks

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Workflows.ComplexityAnalyzer do
  # Analyzes task complexity and returns workflow requirements
  def analyze(task, context) do
    %{
      complexity_score: calculate_complexity(task),
      resource_requirements: estimate_resources(task),
      suggested_agents: determine_agent_needs(task),
      parallelization_strategy: analyze_dependencies(task)
    }
  end
end
```

#### 2. Template Registry
Pre-defined workflow patterns for common scenarios:
- **Simple Analysis**: Linear workflow for basic code analysis
- **Deep Analysis**: Multi-agent parallel analysis with aggregation
- **Generation Pipeline**: Research → Analysis → Generation → Review
- **Refactoring Flow**: Analysis → Planning → Generation → Validation
- **Custom Templates**: User-defined workflow patterns

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Workflows.TemplateRegistry do
  # Returns a workflow template based on task type
  def get_template(task_type, complexity) do
    case {task_type, complexity} do
      {:analysis, :simple} -> SimpleAnalysisTemplate
      {:analysis, :complex} -> DeepAnalysisTemplate
      {:generation, _} -> GenerationPipelineTemplate
      _ -> nil
    end
  end
end
```

#### 3. Dynamic Builder Implementation
Using Reactor.Builder API to construct workflows at runtime:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Workflows.DynamicBuilder do
  def build(task, analysis_result, opts \\ []) do
    reactor = Reactor.Builder.new()
    
    # Add inputs based on task requirements
    reactor = add_dynamic_inputs(reactor, task)
    
    # Add steps based on complexity analysis
    reactor = add_steps_by_complexity(reactor, analysis_result)
    
    # Add resource allocation steps
    reactor = add_resource_management(reactor, analysis_result.resource_requirements)
    
    # Add optimization steps if needed
    reactor = apply_optimizations(reactor, opts[:optimization_strategy])
    
    # Set return value
    finalize_workflow(reactor)
  end
end
```

#### 4. Resource Estimator
Predicts resource needs and manages allocation:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Workflows.ResourceEstimator do
  def estimate(task, historical_data \\ nil) do
    %{
      agents_needed: estimate_agent_count(task),
      memory_required: estimate_memory(task),
      estimated_duration: estimate_time(task, historical_data),
      priority: calculate_priority(task)
    }
  end
  
  def allocate_resources(requirements, available_resources) do
    # Smart allocation based on priority and availability
  end
end
```

#### 5. Optimization Engine
Applies various optimization strategies:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Workflows.OptimizationEngine do
  def optimize(workflow, strategy, constraints) do
    case strategy do
      :speed -> optimize_for_speed(workflow)
      :resource -> optimize_for_resources(workflow)
      :balanced -> balanced_optimization(workflow)
      :ml_driven -> ml_optimization(workflow, constraints)
    end
  end
end
```

### Integration Points

1. **With Existing Executor**: Modify `Executor.execute_workflow/4` to detect dynamic workflow requests
2. **With Agent System**: Use `AgentRegistry` to query available agents and capabilities
3. **With Memory System**: Store successful workflow patterns for future reuse
4. **With Metrics**: Track dynamic workflow performance for optimization

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Workflow construction overhead | High | Cache generated workflows for similar tasks |
| Resource estimation errors | Medium | Implement feedback loop to improve estimates |
| Complex debugging of dynamic workflows | High | Add comprehensive logging and visualization |
| Performance regression vs static workflows | Medium | Fallback to static workflows when appropriate |
| Memory overhead from workflow caching | Low | Implement LRU cache with size limits |

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we support runtime modification of executing workflows?
2. What metrics should drive workflow optimization (speed, resource usage, accuracy)?
3. Should workflows be versioned for rollback capabilities?
4. How should we handle workflow failures during dynamic construction?
5. Should we expose workflow templates to users for customization?

### Example Dynamic Workflow

Here's how a complex code refactoring task would be dynamically constructed:

```elixir
# User Request: "Refactor this module to improve performance"
task = %{
  type: :refactoring,
  target: "lib/my_app/heavy_module.ex",
  goal: :performance,
  constraints: %{max_time: 300_000}
}

# 1. Complexity Analysis
analysis = ComplexityAnalyzer.analyze(task)
# Returns: 
# %{
#   complexity_score: 8.5,
#   resource_requirements: %{agents: 4, memory: :high},
#   suggested_agents: [:research, :analysis, :generation, :review],
#   parallelization_strategy: :parallel_analysis
# }

# 2. Template Selection
template = TemplateRegistry.get_template(:refactoring, :complex)
# Returns RefactoringPipelineTemplate

# 3. Dynamic Building
workflow = DynamicBuilder.build(task, analysis, 
  optimization_strategy: :balanced,
  use_template: template
)

# Generated Workflow Structure:
# 1. Start 2 Research agents in parallel (performance patterns, similar code)
# 2. Run 3 Analysis agents in parallel (performance, complexity, dependencies)
# 3. Aggregate analysis results
# 4. Generate optimization plan
# 5. Implement changes with Generation agent
# 6. Review changes for correctness
# 7. Performance validation
# 8. Final review and documentation

# 4. Execution
result = Executor.run(workflow, task)
```
