# Feature: TUI (Terminal UI) Implementation with Go and Bubble Tea

## Summary
Implement a modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) for RubberDuck using Go and the Bubble Tea framework. This will provide a chat-focused interface with optional file tree and editor panels, seamlessly integrated with Phoenix WebSocket channels for real-time communication with the RubberDuck backend.

## Requirements
- [ ] Modern TUI using Go and Bubble Tea framework following the Elm Architecture
- [ ] Chat-focused interface as primary interaction method (prioritized)
- [ ] Phoenix WebSocket integration focused on conversation channels
- [ ] Optional toggleable file tree and editor panels
- [ ] Syntax highlighting using Chroma library
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts following research document patterns
- [ ] Streaming support for LLM responses
- [ ] Modal dialogs for user interaction
- [ ] Theming and styling support
- [ ] Robust error handling and recovery
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] Direct integration with Phoenix server (no mock mode needed)

## Research Summary

### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- **Elixir Core**: Pattern matching, error handling with `{:ok, result}` tuples, proper function design
- **Ash Framework**: Not directly applicable to Go implementation, but understanding backend patterns

### Documentation Reviewed
- **Bubble Tea Research**: Comprehensive guide available in `research/006-go-bubble-tea-tui.md` showing complete integration patterns
- **Phoenix Channels**: UserSocket shows 4 available channels: `code:*`, `analysis:*`, `workspace:*`, `conversation:*`
- **Authentication**: API key and token-based authentication system already in place

### Existing Patterns Found
- **Phoenix Integration**: `lib/rubber_duck_web/channels/user_socket.ex:7-10` - Channel routing patterns
- **Authentication**: `lib/rubber_duck_web/channels/user_socket.ex:86-97` - API key authentication
- **Backend Architecture**: Multiple specialized channels for different operations

### Technical Approach
1. **Project Structure**: Create `tui/` directory with Go module
2. **Architecture**: Implement Elm Architecture with Model-View-Update pattern
3. **UI Components**: Build composable components using Bubble Tea and Bubbles
4. **WebSocket Integration**: Use nshafer/phx library for Phoenix channel communication, focusing on conversation channels
5. **Layout System**: Implement responsive layout with chat-focused design using Lipgloss styling
6. **State Management**: Centralized state with immutable updates
7. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Go/Bubble Tea learning curve | Medium | Leverage existing research doc and examples |
| Phoenix channel integration complexity | High | Use proven nshafer/phx library and existing patterns |
| Performance with large files | Medium | Implement virtual scrolling and lazy loading |
| Cross-platform compatibility | Medium | Test on multiple platforms, use Bubble Tea best practices |
| State management complexity | Medium | Follow Elm Architecture patterns strictly |

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should I prioritize the chat-focused interface first, or build all components in parallel? **ANSWERED: Yes, prioritize chat-focused interface**
2. Are there any specific Phoenix channels or message formats I should prioritize? **ANSWERED: Focus on conversation channel**
3. Do you have preferences for keyboard shortcuts or should I follow the research document? **ANSWERED: Follow research document**
4. Should I implement a mock mode for development without requiring the Phoenix server? **ANSWERED: No mock mode needed**
