# Feature: Complete Authentication Integration for Conversations

## Summary
Successfully fixed critical security vulnerabilities by completing the integration between Ash authentication and the conversation AI system. Users can now only access their own conversations through proper authorization policies.

## Requirements
- [x] Fix user_id override bug in conversation_channel.ex
- [x] Add User-Conversation relationship in Ash resources
- [x] Implement authorization policies on Conversation resource
- [x] Update conversation creation to enforce user association
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for authorization
- [x] Ensure channel authentication flow is secure
- [x] Verify conversation isolation between users

## Research Summary
### Ash Authorization Patterns Found
- Policy structure with bypass for system operations
- Actor-based authorization using `relates_to_actor_via`
- Field-level policies for sensitive data
- Proper use of `authorize?: false` for system operations

### Critical Issues Identified & Fixed
1. **Channel Bug**: Fixed conversation_channel.ex:116 to use socket.assigns[:user_id]
2. **Missing Relationship**: Added belongs_to :user relationship to Conversation resource
3. **No Policies**: Implemented comprehensive authorization policies on Conversation resource
4. **Creation Flow**: Updated conversation creation to enforce user association through action changes

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Channel Security Fix
- Updated `conversation_channel.ex` to use authenticated user_id from socket
- Added conversation persistence for authenticated users
- Anonymous users can still join channels but don't persist conversations

### 2. Ash Authorization Policies
```elixir
policies do
  # System operations bypass
  bypass actor_attribute_equals(:system, true) do
    authorize_if always()
  end
  
  # User ownership enforcement
  policy action_type(:read) do
    authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:user)
  end
  
  policy action_type(:create) do
    authorize_if actor_present()
  end
  
  policy action_type(:update) do
    authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:user)
  end
  
  policy action_type(:destroy) do
    authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:user)
  end
end
```

### 3. User Association Enforcement
- Added action change to force user_id = actor.id during conversation creation
- Added proper relationships between User and Conversation resources
- Created migration with foreign key constraints

### 4. Database Migration
- Added foreign key constraint between conversations.user_id and users.id
- Cleaned up orphaned conversations during migration
- Added index on user_id for performance

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- User ownership enforcement
- Cross-user access prevention
- System operation bypasses
- Create/Read/Update/Delete authorization
- Edge cases and error conditions

All 11 authorization tests passing successfully.

## Security Improvements
1. **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own conversations
2. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned conversations  
3. **Proper Authentication Flow**: Socket authentication properly flows to conversation creation
4. **System Operations**: Admin/system operations can bypass authorization when needed
5. **Information Leakage Prevention**: Unauthorized access returns NotFound instead of Forbidden

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Ash policies use efficient filtering
- Added database index on user_id for conversation queries
- Read operations filter by user automatically

## Future Enhancements
- Add admin interface with proper system actor
- Implement conversation sharing mechanisms if needed
- Add audit logging for conversation access
