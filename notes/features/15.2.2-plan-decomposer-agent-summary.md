# Feature Implementation Summary: Plan Decomposer Agent

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Plan Decomposer Agent (section 15.2.2) by transforming the existing TaskDecomposer engine into a Jido Agent with signal-based communication.

## What Was Built

### 1. PlanDecomposerAgent Module
- **Location**: `/lib/rubber_duck/agents/plan_decomposer_agent.ex`
- **Architecture**: Uses `RubberDuck.Agents.BaseAgent` built on `Jido.Agent`
- **State Management**: Tracks active decompositions, caching, and configuration
- **Signal Interface**:
  - Input: `decompose_plan` signal with plan_id, query, strategy, context
  - Output: `decomposition_progress`, `decomposition_complete`, `decomposition_failed`

### 2. Decomposition Strategy Actions
Created three Jido.Action modules for different strategies:

- **LinearDecomposer** (`/lib/rubber_duck/agents/plan_decomposer/linear_decomposer.ex`)
  - Sequential task decomposition for simple workflows
  - Automatic dependency chaining

- **HierarchicalDecomposer** (`/lib/rubber_duck/agents/plan_decomposer/hierarchical_decomposer.ex`)
  - Multi-level phase and task breakdown
  - Support for subtasks and critical path identification

- **TreeOfThoughtDecomposer** (`/lib/rubber_duck/agents/plan_decomposer/tree_of_thought_decomposer.ex`)
  - Explores multiple approaches and selects the best
  - Scoring system based on confidence, risk, effort, and goal alignment

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking decomposition using Task.start
- **Caching**: Results cached with 1-hour TTL to avoid redundant LLM calls
- **Validation**: Integration with Critics.Orchestrator for quality checks
- **Strategy Selection**: Automatic or manual strategy selection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with error signals

### 4. Test Coverage
- **Location**: `/test/rubber_duck/agents/plan_decomposer_agent_test.exs`
- **Coverage**: Agent lifecycle, signal handling, strategies, caching, error cases
- **Status**: All tests passing

## Integration Points

### With Existing System
- Uses `RubberDuck.LLM.Service` for AI-powered decomposition
- Integrates with `RubberDuck.Planning.DecompositionTemplates` for prompts
- Validates using `RubberDuck.Planning.Critics.Orchestrator`

### Signal Flow Example
```elixir
# Client sends decomposition request
signal = %{
  "type" => "decompose_plan",
  "plan_id" => "plan_123",
  "query" => "Build user authentication",
  "strategy" => "hierarchical"
}

{:ok, agent} = PlanDecomposerAgent.handle_signal(agent, signal)
# Agent emits progress signal, performs decomposition async
# On completion, emits decomposition_complete with results
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Decoupled Architecture**: Signal-based communication allows loose coupling
2. **Scalability**: Async processing prevents blocking on LLM calls
3. **Performance**: Caching reduces redundant decompositions
4. **Flexibility**: Multiple strategies available based on task type
5. **Reliability**: Error handling and validation ensure quality

## Pending Work

1. **Ash Integration**: Connect to Plan/Task resources for persistence
2. **Progress Tracking**: More granular progress updates during decomposition
3. **Telemetry**: Add metrics for monitoring decomposition performance
4. **Documentation**: Detailed signal interface documentation

## Migration Path

To migrate from TaskDecomposer to PlanDecomposerAgent:

1. Replace direct TaskDecomposer.execute calls with signal emission
2. Listen for decomposition_complete signals instead of waiting for results
3. Handle decomposition_failed signals for error cases

## Conclusion

The Plan Decomposer Agent successfully modernizes the task decomposition system using Jido's agent framework. The implementation maintains all existing functionality while adding async processing, better error handling, and a cleaner architecture through signal-based communication.
