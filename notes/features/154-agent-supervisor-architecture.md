# Feature 15.1.4: Agent Supervisor Architecture

## Overview
This feature implements a robust supervision architecture for Jido agents, providing dynamic agent management, health monitoring, and scalable pool management. The supervisor architecture ensures fault tolerance and enables elastic scaling of agent systems.

## Background
The current Jido integration treats agents as data structures rather than processes. However, for production systems, we need a supervision layer that can:
- Manage agent lifecycle (creation, monitoring, termination)
- Provide fault tolerance through supervision trees
- Enable dynamic scaling based on load
- Monitor agent health and performance
- Coordinate agent pools for efficient resource usage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Main Agent Supervisor (15.1.4.1)
**Goal**: Create the core supervisor infrastructure for managing agents

**Components**:
1. **RubberDuck.Agents.Supervisor**
   - Main supervisor using OTP supervision patterns
   - Dynamic child specifications for different agent types
   - Configurable supervision strategies (one_for_one, rest_for_one, etc.)
   - Restart policies with exponential backoff
   - Graceful shutdown coordination

2. **Agent Child Specs**
   - Generic child_spec/1 for agent processes
   - Support for both temporary and permanent agents
   - Configuration for restart intensity and period
   - Shutdown timeout configuration

3. **Supervision Trees**
   - Hierarchical supervision for agent groups
   - Isolated failure domains
   - Dynamic supervisor for runtime agent creation

### Phase 2: Agent Registry (15.1.4.2)
**Goal**: Implement a distributed registry for agent discovery and metadata

**Components**:
1. **Registry Module**
   - ETS-based registry for local lookups
   - Support for distributed registries (via :global or Registry)
   - Agent metadata storage (capabilities, status, metrics)
   - Tag-based agent discovery
   - Query API for finding agents by criteria

2. **Registration Protocol**
   - Automatic registration on agent start
   - Deregistration on termination
   - Metadata updates during lifecycle
   - Conflict resolution for duplicate names

3. **Discovery Mechanisms**
   - Find agents by type/capability
   - Load-based selection
   - Geographic/node-based discovery
   - Service mesh integration hooks

### Phase 3: Agent Pool Management (15.1.4.3)
**Goal**: Create intelligent pooling for efficient resource usage

**Components**:
1. **Pool Manager**
   - Configurable pool sizes (min, max, target)
   - Different pooling strategies (round-robin, least-loaded, random)
   - Overflow handling
   - Pool warmup on startup

2. **Dynamic Scaling**
   - Load-based scaling algorithms
   - Predictive scaling using historical data
   - Cool-down periods to prevent flapping
   - Resource limits and quotas

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Work distribution strategies
   - Queue management for pending work
   - Back-pressure mechanisms
   - Fairness guarantees

### Phase 4: Health Monitoring System (15.1.4.4)
**Goal**: Comprehensive health monitoring and self-healing

**Components**:
1. **Health Check Protocol**
   - Standardized health check interface
   - Configurable check intervals
   - Custom health check implementations
   - Aggregate health status

2. **Probes**
   - Liveness probes (is agent alive?)
   - Readiness probes (can agent accept work?)
   - Startup probes (is agent initialized?)
   - Custom probe definitions

3. **Circuit Breakers**
   - Failure detection and isolation
   - Automatic recovery attempts
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Circuit state notifications

4. **Health Dashboards**
   - Real-time health visualization
   - Historical health trends
   - Alert integration
   - SLA monitoring

### Phase 5: Agent Lifecycle Telemetry (15.1.4.5)
**Goal**: Comprehensive observability for agent systems

**Components**:
1. **Lifecycle Events**
   - Agent spawn/terminate events
   - State transitions
   - Error and crash events
   - Recovery events

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Request latency
   - Throughput metrics
   - Queue depths
   - Resource utilization

3. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Memory usage per agent
   - CPU utilization
   - Message queue sizes
   - Network I/O

4. **Telemetry Integration**
   - OpenTelemetry support
   - Metrics exporters (Prometheus, StatsD)
   - Distributed tracing
   - Custom telemetry handlers

## Technical Considerations

### Integration with Jido
- Agents remain data structures as per Jido design
- Supervisor manages GenServer processes that hold agent state
- Clean separation between agent logic and process management

### Fault Tolerance
- Isolated failure domains per agent type
- Configurable restart strategies
- State recovery after crashes
- Graceful degradation under load

### Performance
- Efficient ETS-based lookups
- Minimal overhead for health checks
- Async telemetry to avoid blocking
- Pool pre-warming for fast startup

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling across nodes
- Dynamic pool sizing
- Load-based routing
- Back-pressure handling

## Migration Strategy
1. Implement supervisor without breaking existing agent usage
2. Gradual migration of agents to supervised processes
3. Backward compatibility for direct agent usage
4. Feature flags for enabling supervision

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for supervision trees
- Chaos testing for fault tolerance
- Load testing for pool scaling
- Property-based testing for registry consistency

## Success Metrics
- Zero agent crashes causing system failure
- < 1ms registry lookup time
- Automatic scaling within 10 seconds
- 99.9% health check accuracy
- Complete telemetry coverage

## Dependencies
- Jido framework (for agent definitions)
- Telemetry library
- Registry or :global for distribution
- ETS for local storage
- OpenTelemetry (optional)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Complexity of distributed registry
  - **Mitigation**: Start with local registry, add distribution later
  
- **Risk**: Performance overhead of health checks
  - **Mitigation**: Configurable check intervals, sampling strategies
  
- **Risk**: Pool scaling instability
  - **Mitigation**: Cool-down periods, gradual scaling

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-region agent deployment
- Agent migration between nodes
- Predictive failure detection
- Auto-tuning of pool parameters
- Integration with Kubernetes operators
