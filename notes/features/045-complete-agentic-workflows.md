# Feature: Complete Agentic Workflows Implementation

## Summary
Complete the implementation of section 4.5 by creating the missing specialized agents (Analysis, Generation, Review), implementing inter-agent communication protocols, and integrating with the existing Reactor workflow system.

## Requirements
- [ ] Implement AnalysisAgent with code analysis capabilities using existing analysis engines
- [ ] Implement GenerationAgent with code generation capabilities using existing generation engine
- [ ] Implement ReviewAgent with quality review capabilities using analysis and self-correction
- [ ] Create inter-agent communication protocols building on MessageBus
- [ ] Integrate agents with Reactor workflow system for multi-step operations
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for all agent components
- [ ] Ensure fault tolerance and recovery through supervision tree
- [ ] Support concurrent agent operations with proper resource management
- [ ] Enable agent learning and adaptation through memory system integration

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- OTP patterns: DynamicSupervisor with Registry for fault-tolerant process management
- GenServer patterns: Standard callbacks with state management and health monitoring
- Behavior usage: Agent.Behavior defines required callbacks for all agents
- MessageBus: Pub/sub and request/response patterns for decoupled communication

### Documentation Reviewed
- Agent architecture: Base Agent GenServer handles common functionality
- Behavior callbacks: init/1, handle_task/3, handle_message/3, get_capabilities/1, get_status/1, terminate/2
- ResearchAgent: Complete implementation showing task handling patterns
- Analysis engines: Semantic, Style, and Security analyzers available
- Generation engine: RAG-based code generation with validation
- LLM service: Multi-provider support with fallback and rate limiting
- Self-correction: Iterative improvement with convergence detection

### Existing Patterns Found
- Pattern 1: [lib/rubber_duck/agents/research_agent.ex:79] Task type dispatch with specific handlers
- Pattern 2: [lib/rubber_duck/agents/agent.ex:356] Task execution with status updates and metrics
- Pattern 3: [lib/rubber_duck/agents/coordinator.ex:246] Workflow orchestration with step dependencies
- Pattern 4: [lib/rubber_duck/analysis/semantic.ex:50] Analysis task execution patterns
- Pattern 5: [lib/rubber_duck/engines/generation.ex:130] Code generation with RAG context
- Pattern 6: [lib/rubber_duck/self_correction/engine.ex:90] Iterative correction with strategies

### Technical Approach
1. **AnalysisAgent Implementation**:
   - Leverage existing analysis engines (Semantic, Style, Security)
   - Support task types: analyze_code, security_review, complexity_analysis, pattern_detection
   - Integrate with AST parser for deep code analysis
   - Use self-correction for improving analysis accuracy

2. **GenerationAgent Implementation**:
   - Use existing Generation engine with RAG capabilities
   - Support task types: generate_code, refactor_code, fix_code, complete_code
   - Integrate with LLM service for natural language processing
   - Apply self-correction for code quality improvement

3. **ReviewAgent Implementation**:
   - Combine analysis engines for comprehensive review
   - Support task types: review_changes, quality_review, suggest_improvements, verify_correctness
   - Use LLM service for generating human-readable feedback
   - Apply self-correction for consistency in reviews

4. **Communication Protocol**:
   - Build on existing MessageBus for pub/sub
   - Define standard message formats for agent coordination
   - Implement request/response patterns for synchronous communication
   - Add broadcast capabilities for multi-agent notifications

5. **Workflow Integration**:
   - Create Reactor step types for agent tasks
   - Implement agent pool management in workflows
   - Support parallel agent execution with dependency resolution
   - Enable result aggregation from multiple agents

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Agent communication deadlocks | High | Use timeouts and circuit breakers in all agent interactions |
| Resource exhaustion with multiple agents | Medium | Implement agent pooling with configurable limits |
| Inconsistent results between agents | Medium | Use self-correction and consensus mechanisms |
| Integration complexity with workflows | Medium | Start with simple sequential workflows, then add parallelism |
| Test coverage for concurrent operations | High | Use property-based testing for agent interactions |

- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing agent functionality

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should agents have configurable resource limits (memory, execution time)?
2. How should agents handle conflicting analysis results or recommendations?
3. Should we implement agent-specific caching strategies for performance?
4. What level of agent autonomy is desired for decision-making?
5. Should agents be able to spawn sub-agents for complex tasks?
