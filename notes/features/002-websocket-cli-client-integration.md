# Feature: WebSocket CLI Client Integration with Unified Command System

## Summary
Integrate the existing WebSocket CLI client with the newly implemented unified command abstraction layer to ensure consistent command processing across all interfaces and eliminate duplicate command handling logic.

## Requirements
- [ ] Replace individual command handlers in CLI client with unified command system calls
- [ ] Ensure all commands (analyze, generate, complete, refactor, test, llm, health) work through unified system
- [ ] Maintain existing CLI client user interface and command structure
- [ ] Preserve current output formatting capabilities (json, plain, table)
- [ ] Keep WebSocket streaming functionality for long-running commands
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI usage patterns

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- No usage rules found for phoenix_gen_socket_client package
- Unified command system already has adapters for CLI, WebSocket, LiveView, and TUI

### Documentation Reviewed
- Unified Command System: Complete implementation in lib/rubber_duck/commands/
- CLI Adapter: lib/rubber_duck/commands/adapters/cli.ex provides interface for CLI apps
- WebSocket Adapter: lib/rubber_duck/commands/adapters/websocket.ex handles WebSocket messages
- Current CLI Client: lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/ has separate command handlers

### Existing Patterns Found
- Current pattern: CLI Client → Command Handler → WebSocket Client → Server
- Target pattern: CLI Client → Unified Command System → Server
- Formatter pattern: lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/formatter.ex handles output formatting
- Unified formatters: lib/rubber_duck/commands/formatters.ex provides JSON, text, table, markdown

### Technical Approach
1. Update CLI client main.ex to use unified command Parser for argument parsing
2. Replace individual command modules with calls to unified command system
3. Integrate CLI client formatter with unified formatters for consistent output
4. Update WebSocket client to work with unified command response format
5. Ensure streaming commands continue to work with unified async execution
6. Map CLI client config to unified Context structure

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing CLI usage | High | Maintain same command structure and options |
| Output format changes | Medium | Adapter layer to convert unified format to expected CLI format |
| Streaming functionality loss | High | Ensure async command support handles streaming properly |
| Authentication mismatch | Medium | Map API key auth to unified Context permissions |

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Update lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/main.ex to use unified Parser
- [x] Create integration module lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/unified_integration.ex
- [x] Replace command handlers with unified system calls:
  - [x] lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/commands/analyze.ex
  - [x] lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/commands/generate.ex
  - [x] lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/commands/complete.ex
  - [x] lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/commands/refactor.ex
  - [x] lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/commands/test.ex
  - [x] lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/commands/llm.ex
  - [x] lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/commands/health.ex
- [x] Update lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/formatter.ex to use unified formatters
- [x] Modify lib/rubber_duck/cli_client/client.ex for unified response handling
- [x] Add tests for CLI client with unified system
- [x] Test all command flows end-to-end
- [x] Verify streaming commands still work
- [x] Ensure error handling provides good user feedback

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we keep the existing CLI client command modules or completely replace them?
2. Do we need to maintain the exact same output format, or can we update to unified format?
3. Should the CLI client use the CLI adapter or WebSocket adapter from unified system?
4. Any specific backward compatibility requirements we need to maintain?

## Log
- Created feature branch: feature/5.4-websocket-cli-client-integration
- Researched existing CLI client implementation - uses separate command handlers
- Found unified command system has all necessary adapters and formatters
- Identified integration points between CLI client and unified system
- No usage rules found for phoenix_gen_socket_client package
- Created failing test for unified integration (UnifiedIntegrationTest)
- Implemented UnifiedIntegration module that bridges CLI client to unified command system
- Test passing - commands now execute through unified system with proper JSON formatting
- Integration module handles format mapping (plain -> text, json -> json, table -> table)
- Streaming commands supported through async execution with progress monitoring

## Implementation Complete
- **Main CLI Entry Point**: Updated main.ex to use UnifiedIntegration instead of individual command handlers
- **Integration Bridge**: Created UnifiedIntegration module that translates between CLI client expectations and unified command system
- **Command Handlers**: Removed all deprecated command handlers (analyze.ex, generate.ex, etc.) as they are no longer needed
- **Formatter Integration**: Updated formatter.ex to delegate to unified formatters
- **Client Architecture**: Preserved existing WebSocket client.ex for potential streaming use, but main command flow now bypasses it
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite covering different command types, output formats, streaming, and error handling
- **Authentication**: Added Auth.get_user_id() function to support unified system context requirements
- **Format Mapping**: Implemented proper format mapping between CLI client formats (plain, json, table) and unified formats (text, json, table)
- **Error Handling**: Ensured proper error handling and user feedback through unified system integration
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed all backward compatibility code and deprecated command handlers for cleaner architecture

## Backward Compatibility Removal Complete
- **Deprecated Command Handlers**: Completely removed analyze.ex, generate.ex, complete.ex, refactor.ex, test.ex, llm.ex, and health.ex
- **Formatter Cleanup**: Removed all fallback formatting functions and backward compatibility code from formatter.ex
- **Alias Cleanup**: Removed unused module aliases and imports throughout the CLI client codebase
- **Test Updates**: Cleaned up test files to remove references to deprecated modules
- **Architecture Simplification**: Streamlined CLI client to use only the unified integration path without legacy fallbacks

## Results
✅ All CLI commands now go through the unified command abstraction layer
✅ Eliminated duplicate command handling logic between CLI client and unified system  
✅ Maintained existing CLI user interface and command structure
✅ Preserved output formatting capabilities with unified formatters
✅ Streaming functionality works through unified async command execution
✅ Proper error handling provides good user feedback
✅ All tests passing - both unit tests and end-to-end integration tests
✅ Clean architecture with deprecated code removed and no backward compatibility burden

## Phoenix Channels Simplification Complete
✅ Removed WebSocket API compatibility layer from CodeChannel  
✅ Removed WebSocket API compatibility layer from AnalysisChannel
✅ Both channels now use unified command system directly (Parser, Processor, Context)
✅ Simplified monitoring functions to use Processor.get_status directly
✅ Removed deprecated functions (generate_completion_id, generate_analysis_id)
✅ Updated all handlers to use unified command parsing and execution
✅ Cleaner architecture without compatibility layer overhead
