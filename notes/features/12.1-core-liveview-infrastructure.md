# Feature Plan: 12.1 Core LiveView Infrastructure

## Overview
Implement the foundational LiveView architecture for the collaborative coding interface. This will provide real-time state management, WebSocket integration, and multi-component coordination for a chat-centric coding environment with toggleable panels.

## Requirements
Based on Phase 12.1 of the implementation plan:
1. Create main LiveView module (`CodingSessionLive`) as the coordinator
2. Implement Phoenix PubSub subscriptions for real-time updates
3. Design comprehensive state management architecture
4. Integrate with existing WebSocket channels
5. Create responsive layout management system
6. Build error handling and recovery mechanisms
7. Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
8. Set up telemetry for UI metrics

## Research Findings
From examining the codebase:
1. **Existing LiveView patterns**: `StatusDashboardLive` provides a good example of LiveView implementation with periodic updates and telemetry
2. **Authentication**: `LiveUserAuth` module provides authentication helpers for LiveViews
3. **Channels available**: CodeChannel, ConversationChannel, WorkspaceChannel for integration
4. **Presence**: RubberDuckWeb.Presence is already set up for tracking users
5. **Router configuration**: LiveView routes use `ash_authentication_live_session` for auth

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Create CodingSessionLive Module
- Follow patterns from StatusDashboardLive
- Use `on_mount {RubberDuckWeb.LiveUserAuth, :live_user_required}` for authentication
- Implement mount/3, handle_event/3, handle_info/3 callbacks
- Design socket assigns structure for state management

### 2. State Management Architecture
```elixir
socket
|> assign(:project_id, project_id)
|> assign(:current_file, nil)
|> assign(:file_tree, [])
|> assign(:chat_messages, [])
|> assign(:editor_content, "")
|> assign(:layout, %{
    show_file_tree: true,
    show_editor: true,
    chat_width: "flex-1",
    tree_width: "w-64",
    editor_width: "w-1/2"
  })
|> assign(:presence_users, %{})
|> assign(:streaming_message, nil)
|> assign(:connection_status, :connected)
```

### 3. PubSub Architecture
- Subscribe to: `project:#{project_id}`, `editor:#{project_id}`, `chat:#{project_id}`
- Handle broadcasts for file changes, chat messages, presence updates
- Implement proper cleanup on termination

### 4. Channel Integration
- Connect to CodeChannel for code operations
- Connect to ConversationChannel for chat functionality
- Handle streaming responses with proper state updates
- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff

### 5. Layout Management
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Implement panel toggle functionality with smooth transitions
- Store layout preferences in session/local storage
- Calculate dynamic widths based on visible panels

### 6. Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries with fallback UI
- Add connection status indicators
- Handle channel disconnections gracefully
- Provide user feedback for all error states

### 7. Keyboard Shortcuts
- Use phx-window-keydown for global shortcuts
- Implement focus management between panels
- Add accessibility announcements for screen readers
- Document all shortcuts in help modal

### 8. Telemetry Integration
- Track panel usage metrics
- Monitor WebSocket connection stability
- Measure interaction latency
- Report errors to monitoring system

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create basic CodingSessionLive module structure
- [ ] Implement mount with project loading
- [ ] Set up PubSub subscriptions
- [ ] Design socket assigns structure
- [ ] Create layout HTML with Tailwind
- [ ] Implement panel toggle functionality
- [ ] Add channel connections
- [ ] Handle streaming messages
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Create loading states
- [ ] Set up telemetry events
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Document component API

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual handle_event callbacks
2. **Connected Tests**: Test PubSub and channel integration
3. **Feature Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader support
5. **Performance Tests**: Ensure smooth updates with large file trees

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Risk**: Complex state management with multiple channels
   - **Mitigation**: Use clear state structure and document data flow
   
2. **Risk**: Performance with large projects
   - **Mitigation**: Implement virtual scrolling and lazy loading
   
3. **Risk**: WebSocket connection instability
   - **Mitigation**: Robust reconnection logic with state recovery

## Success Criteria
1. LiveView loads and authenticates users properly
2. All three panels (tree, chat, editor) render correctly
3. Panel toggling works smoothly
4. PubSub updates reflect in real-time
5. Channel connections establish and maintain
6. Keyboard shortcuts function as designed
7. Error states handled gracefully
8. Telemetry events fire correctly
9. Tests provide good coverage
10. Accessibility standards met
