# Feature: Error Detection Agent (Section 15.6.1)

## Summary
Implements a comprehensive error detection agent that monitors, identifies, classifies, and reports errors across the RubberDuck system through signal-based coordination, providing proactive error detection with pattern recognition and automated response capabilities.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create ErrorDetectionAgent module using BaseAgent pattern
- [ ] Implement error monitoring for syntax, logic, runtime, quality, and security issues
- [ ] Build pattern recognition system for error clustering and trending
- [ ] Add classification system with severity scoring and impact analysis
- [ ] Create detection metrics with coverage tracking and optimization
- [ ] Support real-time error detection and batch analysis
- [ ] Integrate with existing telemetry and logging systems
- [ ] Provide actionable error reports with correction suggestions
- [ ] Implement false positive reduction mechanisms
- [ ] Support multiple error source types and detection strategies

## Research Summary

### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Jido.Agent: Signal-based agent architecture with handle_signal/2 pattern
- BaseAgent: RubberDuck-specific agent utilities with lifecycle hooks
- Telemetry: Existing error event handling via handle_error_event/4

### Documentation Reviewed
- BaseAgent pattern: Uses Jido.Agent foundation with RubberDuck extensions
- Signal handling: Agents respond to typed signals with structured data
- Error telemetry: Basic error event reporting already exists in tool/telemetry.ex

### Existing Patterns Found
- MemoryCoordinatorAgent: Complex signal handling with state management (memory_coordinator_agent.ex:62)
- TokenManagerAgent: Metrics tracking and error handling patterns
- BaseAgent: Lifecycle callbacks and health checks (base_agent.ex:54-81)
- Telemetry: Error event handling (tool/telemetry.ex:handle_error_event)

### Technical Approach
1. **Agent Structure**: Use BaseAgent with signal-based architecture
2. **Error Sources**: Monitor multiple error types through dedicated detection modules
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Implement ML-based clustering and statistical analysis
4. **Classification**: Create error taxonomy with severity and impact scoring
5. **Metrics**: Track detection rates, false positives, and system coverage
6. **Integration**: Connect with existing telemetry and logging infrastructure

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| High false positive rate | Medium | Implement confidence scoring and learning mechanisms |
| Performance overhead from monitoring | High | Use sampling and async processing |
| Memory usage from pattern storage | Medium | Implement pattern aging and compression |
| Complex error classification | Medium | Start with simple rules, evolve to ML-based |
| Integration with existing systems | Low | Use signal-based loose coupling |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create RubberDuck.Agents.ErrorDetectionAgent module
- [ ] Implement error source detection modules (syntax, logic, runtime, quality, security)
- [ ] Build pattern recognition system with clustering algorithms
- [ ] Add classification system with taxonomy and severity scoring
- [ ] Create metrics collection and reporting
- [ ] Add signal handlers for error detection requests
- [ ] Implement detection optimization based on feedback
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Verify integration with existing telemetry
- [ ] Test error detection accuracy and performance

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should the error detection be real-time only or also support batch analysis of historical data?
2. What level of integration with external tools (linters, static analyzers) is desired?
3. Should the agent learn from correction feedback to improve detection accuracy?
