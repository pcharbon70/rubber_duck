# Section 9.3: Tool Integration Bridge

## Overview

The Tool Integration Bridge provides seamless connectivity between RubberDuck's internal tool system and external services, enabling automatic tool exposure through standardized protocols and intelligent discovery capabilities.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components

1. **RubberDuck.Tool.ExternalAdapter** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/external_adapter.ex`)
   - Converts tool metadata to multiple external formats (OpenAPI, Anthropic, OpenAI, LangChain)
   - Maps external parameters to internal tool format with type conversion
   - Transforms tool results to standard response formats
   - Supports JSON, XML, and other output formats
   - Handles both synchronous and asynchronous execution

2. **RubberDuck.Tool.ExternalRegistry** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/external_registry.ex`)
   - GenServer that manages automatic tool registration
   - Scans tool registry on startup and registers with external services
   - Handles hot reloading with automatic re-registration
   - Supports multiple external service configurations
   - Periodic scanning in development mode
   - Manages tool versioning and updates

3. **RubberDuck.Tool.ExternalRouter** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/external_router.ex`)
   - Routes external tool calls through internal execution system
   - Manages concurrent execution limits
   - Provides progress streaming via Phoenix.PubSub
   - Handles authorization through existing system
   - Supports request cancellation
   - Tracks execution status and results

4. **RubberDuck.Tool.CapabilityAPI** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/capability_api.ex`)
   - Exposes tool capabilities and metadata
   - Generates OpenAPI specifications
   - Provides tool search and recommendations
   - Advertises future composition capabilities
   - Returns quality metrics and performance data
   - Supports multiple query formats

5. **RubberDuck.Tool.Streaming** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/streaming.ex`)
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) support for web clients
   - WebSocket streaming via Phoenix Channels
   - Chunked HTTP response handling
   - Progressive result streaming with buffering
   - Base64 encoding for binary data
   - Configurable chunk sizes

6. **RubberDuck.Tool.StatePersistence** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/state_persistence.ex`)
   - Session-based tool state management
   - Execution history tracking with ETS and disk persistence
   - Tool usage statistics and analytics
   - Automatic cleanup of old states
   - Multi-node support considerations
   - Configurable retention policies

7. **RubberDuck.Tool.DiscoveryEnhanced** (`lib/rubber_duck/tool/discovery_enhanced.ex`)
   - Semantic search with keyword matching (embeddings ready)
   - Context-based tool recommendations
   - Tool compatibility checking
   - Performance profiling and optimization suggestions
   - Similar tool discovery
   - Usage trend analysis

### External Format Support

The adapter supports multiple external formats:

- **OpenAPI**: Full operation specifications with parameters and responses
- **Anthropic**: Tool specifications with input schemas
- **OpenAI**: Function calling format with parameter schemas
- **LangChain**: Tool specifications with metadata and tags

### Streaming Protocols

Three streaming protocols are implemented:

1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: For web browser clients
2. **WebSocket**: Via Phoenix Channels for real-time updates
3. **HTTP Chunked**: For progressive downloads

### State Management

State persistence provides:

- Session-scoped tool state storage
- Execution history with detailed metrics
- Statistical analysis of tool usage
- Automatic cleanup based on TTL
- Both memory (ETS) and disk storage

## Key Design Decisions

### Automatic Registration
- Tools are automatically discovered and registered on startup
- Hot reloading triggers re-registration
- External services are configured via application config
- Registration failures don't prevent tool usage

### Progress Streaming
- All async executions support progress callbacks
- Progress events are broadcast via PubSub
- Multiple clients can subscribe to the same execution
- Events include structured metadata

### Parameter Mapping
- Automatic type conversion from external formats
- Support for complex types (arrays, maps)
- Missing optional parameters are handled gracefully
- Required parameter validation with clear errors

### No Tool Composition
- As specified, tool composition is advertised but not implemented
- Compatibility checking prepares for future composition
- API returns "planned features" for composition queries

## Testing Coverage

Comprehensive test suites cover:

1. **ExternalAdapterTest**: Format conversion, parameter mapping, execution
2. **ExternalRouterTest**: Routing, authorization, concurrent limits, streaming
3. **CapabilityAPITest**: Capability queries, search, recommendations
4. **IntegrationBridgeTest**: End-to-end flows, all components working together

## Integration Points

The bridge integrates with:

- **Tool Registry**: For tool discovery and metadata
- **Tool Executor**: For actual tool execution
- **Tool Validator**: For parameter validation
- **Tool Authorizer**: For access control
- **Phoenix.PubSub**: For event broadcasting
- **Monitoring System**: For metrics and telemetry

## Usage Examples

### Registering Tools with External Services

```elixir
# Automatic registration on startup
config :rubber_duck, RubberDuck.Tool.ExternalRegistry,
  auto_register: true,
  openapi_enabled: true,
  anthropic_enabled: true,
  anthropic_api_key: System.get_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

### Executing Tools via External Interface

```elixir
# Route external call
{:ok, request_id} = ExternalRouter.route_call(
  "my_tool",
  %{"param1" => "value1"},
  %{user: current_user}
)

# Subscribe to progress
ExternalRouter.subscribe_to_progress(request_id)

# Check status
{:ok, status} = ExternalRouter.get_status(request_id)
```

### Discovering Tools

```elixir
# Semantic search
{:ok, results} = DiscoveryEnhanced.semantic_search("data processing")

# Get recommendations
{:ok, recommendations} = DiscoveryEnhanced.recommend_tools(user_context)

# Check compatibility
{:ok, compatibility} = DiscoveryEnhanced.check_compatibility(:tool1, :tool2)
```

## Performance Considerations

- ETS-based caching for fast state access
- Streaming for large results to avoid memory pressure
- Concurrent execution limits to prevent overload
- Progress events are throttled to avoid flooding
- State cleanup prevents unbounded growth

## Security Features

- All external calls go through authorization
- Rate limiting support in capability metadata
- Capability-based access control
- Context isolation between sessions
- No direct exposure of internal tool details

## Future Enhancements

While not implemented, the architecture supports:

- Embedding-based semantic search
- ML-powered tool recommendations
- Actual tool composition pipelines
- Distributed execution coordination
- Advanced caching strategies

## Conclusion

The Tool Integration Bridge successfully connects RubberDuck's sophisticated internal tool system with external services, providing automatic registration, multiple format support, streaming capabilities, and intelligent discovery features. The implementation maintains security and performance while preparing for future enhancements like tool composition.
