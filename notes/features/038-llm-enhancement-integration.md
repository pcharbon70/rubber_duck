# Feature 3.8: LLM Enhancement Integration

## Overview
Create unified interfaces for combining CoT (Chain-of-Thought), RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and Self-Correction techniques. This feature will coordinate different enhancement techniques to improve LLM outputs.

## Implementation Tasks

### 3.8.1 Create Enhancement Coordinator Module
- Build `RubberDuck.Enhancement.Coordinator` as the central orchestrator
- Implement GenServer for managing enhancement pipelines
- Handle concurrent enhancement requests

### 3.8.2 Implement Technique Selection Logic
- Task complexity analysis to determine appropriate techniques
- Pattern matching for technique selection
- Dynamic composition based on task requirements

### 3.8.3 Build Enhancement Pipelines
- Sequential enhancement for ordered operations
- Parallel enhancement for independent techniques
- Conditional enhancement based on intermediate results

### 3.8.4 Create Unified Metrics Framework
- Collect metrics from all enhancement techniques
- Aggregate performance data
- Track effectiveness of different combinations

### 3.8.5 Implement A/B Testing Support
- Framework for comparing technique combinations
- Statistical significance testing
- Result analysis and reporting

### 3.8.6 Add Enhancement Effectiveness Tracking
- Monitor improvement rates
- Track resource usage per technique
- Identify optimal combinations for different tasks

### 3.8.7 Build Configuration Management
- DSL for defining enhancement configurations
- Runtime configuration updates
- Per-task configuration overrides

### 3.8.8 Create Documentation
- Technique usage guidelines
- Best practices for combinations
- Performance tuning recommendations

## Key Components

### Coordinator
The main orchestrator that:
- Analyzes incoming tasks
- Selects appropriate techniques
- Builds and executes pipelines
- Collects and reports metrics

### TechniqueSelector
Determines which enhancement techniques to apply based on:
- Task type (code generation, analysis, documentation)
- Complexity metrics
- Available resources
- Historical performance data

### PipelineBuilder
Constructs execution pipelines:
- Sequential chains for dependent operations
- Parallel branches for independent techniques
- Conditional paths based on intermediate results

### MetricsCollector
Unified metrics collection:
- Technique-specific metrics
- Overall pipeline performance
- Resource utilization
- Quality improvements

## Integration Points

1. **CoT Integration**: Connect with Chain-of-Thought reasoning
2. **RAG Integration**: Leverage retrieval-augmented generation
3. **Self-Correction**: Apply iterative improvement
4. **LLM Service**: Interface with language models
5. **Memory System**: Access historical performance data

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for technique combinations
3. Performance tests for pipeline efficiency
4. A/B testing framework validation
5. Metrics accuracy verification

## Success Criteria

- Measurable improvement in LLM output quality
- Efficient technique selection based on task type
- Minimal overhead from coordination layer
- Comprehensive metrics for optimization
- Flexible configuration system
