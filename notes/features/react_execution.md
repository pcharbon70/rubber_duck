# ReAct-Based Execution Framework

## Summary

The ReAct (Reasoning-Acting) execution framework provides an intelligent, adaptive approach to plan execution by combining reasoning about tasks with dynamic action execution and observational learning. This framework enables the system to think through tasks, execute appropriate actions, observe outcomes, and adjust strategies based on real-time feedback.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **PlanExecutor (GenServer)** - Main orchestrator managing the execution lifecycle
2. **ThoughtGenerator** - Generates reasoning and execution strategies for tasks
3. **ActionExecutor** - Executes actions based on generated thoughts
4. **ObservationCollector** - Collects and analyzes execution results
5. **PlanAdjuster** - Dynamically adjusts plans based on observations
6. **ExecutionState** - Manages task state, dependencies, and progress
7. **History** - Tracks complete execution history for analysis and learning

### ReAct Cycle

```
Task → Thought → Action → Observation → Adjustment → Next Task
  ↑                                                       ↓
  ←←←←←←←←← Feedback Loop ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←

## Implementation Details

### Task Execution Flow

1. **Plan Initialization**
   ```elixir
   {:ok, executor} = PlanExecutor.start_link(plan: plan)
   :ok = PlanExecutor.execute(executor)
   ```

2. **ReAct Cycle Execution**
   - **Thought Generation**: Analyze task context and generate execution strategy
   - **Action Execution**: Execute task using workflows, engines, or tools
   - **Observation Collection**: Gather metrics, detect anomalies, generate insights
   - **Plan Adjustment**: Modify plan if observations indicate issues

3. **State Updates**
   - Track task completion and failures
   - Update dependency satisfaction
   - Broadcast progress updates

### Execution Strategies

#### Direct Execution
- Simple, straightforward task execution
- Used for low-complexity tasks with no failures

#### Careful Execution
- Enhanced monitoring and validation
- Applied to complex tasks or those with potential issues

#### Validation Execution
- Pre-execution dependency and resource validation
- Used for tasks with many dependencies

#### Retry Strategies
- **With Delay**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **With Fixes**: Apply corrections based on failure analysis
- **With Modifications**: Adjust execution parameters after multiple attempts

### Observation and Analysis

#### Metrics Collection
```elixir
%{
  execution_time: 5000,      # milliseconds
  memory_usage: %{...},      # memory statistics
  cpu_usage: %{...},         # CPU utilization
  io_operations: %{...},     # I/O metrics
  result_size: 1024         # bytes
}
```

#### Anomaly Detection
- **Slow Execution**: Execution time > 2x average
- **Large Results**: Output size > 1MB
- **Repeated Failures**: 3+ consecutive failures
- **Resource Constraints**: High CPU/memory usage

#### Insight Generation
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Resource usage recommendations
- Failure pattern analysis
- Alternative approach suggestions

### Plan Adjustment Strategies

#### Simplification
- Reduce task complexity levels
- Break down complex tasks into simpler ones
- Mark non-critical tasks as optional

#### Parallelization
- Group independent tasks for concurrent execution
- Optimize task scheduling based on dependencies
- Balance resource utilization

#### Resource Optimization
- Reduce batch sizes for memory constraints
- Add rate limiting for CPU constraints
- Implement throttling for I/O-bound tasks

#### Failure Handling
- Replace failing tasks with alternatives
- Skip non-critical tasks that repeatedly fail
- Apply fixes based on failure analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic Plan Execution
```elixir
# Create a plan with tasks
plan = %Plan{
  id: "analysis_plan",
  tasks: [
    %Task{id: "data_fetch", dependencies: []},
    %Task{id: "data_process", dependencies: ["data_fetch"]},
    %Task{id: "report_generate", dependencies: ["data_process"]}
  ]
}

# Start executor and execute
{:ok, executor} = PlanExecutor.start_link(plan: plan)
:ok = PlanExecutor.execute(executor)

# Monitor progress
{:ok, progress} = PlanExecutor.get_progress(executor)
IO.inspect(progress.progress_percentage)  # => 33.3
```

### Real-time Progress Monitoring
```elixir
# Subscribe to progress updates
PlanExecutor.subscribe_to_progress(executor)

# Receive updates
receive do
  {:progress_update, progress} ->
    Logger.info("Progress: #{progress.progress_percentage}%")
    Logger.info("Completed: #{progress.completed_tasks}")
    Logger.info("Failed: #{progress.failed_tasks}")
end
```

### Historical Analysis
```elixir
# Get execution history
{:ok, history} = PlanExecutor.get_history(executor)

# Analyze patterns
summary = History.summary(history)
IO.inspect(summary.execution_patterns)

# Export for external analysis
export_data = History.export(history)
File.write!("execution_analysis.json", Jason.encode!(export_data))
```

### Custom Execution Strategies
```elixir
# Tasks can specify custom execution approaches
task = %Task{
  id: "critical_task",
  complexity: :very_complex,
  metadata: %{
    execution_strategy: :careful_execution,
    timeout: 300_000,  # 5 minutes
    max_retries: 5
  }
