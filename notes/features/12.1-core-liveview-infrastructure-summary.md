# Implementation Summary: 12.1 Core LiveView Infrastructure

## Overview
Successfully implemented the foundational LiveView architecture for the collaborative coding interface as specified in Phase 12.1 of the implementation plan. The implementation provides real-time state management, WebSocket integration, and multi-component coordination for a chat-centric coding environment with toggleable panels.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. CodingSessionLive Module (lib/rubber_duck_web/live/coding_session_live.ex)
- Created the main LiveView coordinator module
- Implemented authentication using `on_mount {RubberDuckWeb.LiveUserAuth, :live_user_required}`
- Set up comprehensive state management for:
  - Project information
  - File tree state
  - Chat messages and input
  - Editor content
  - Layout preferences (toggleable panels)
  - User presence tracking
  - Connection status
  - Streaming messages

### 2. PubSub Architecture
- Configured subscriptions to three main channels:
  - `project:#{project_id}` - for project-wide updates
  - `editor:#{project_id}` - for code editor updates
  - `chat:#{project_id}` - for chat messages
- Implemented message handlers for:
  - Chat messages (broadcast and receive)
  - Editor updates
  - Presence diffs
  - Project updates

### 3. Layout Management
- Implemented a responsive three-panel layout:
  - Left: File tree (toggleable)
  - Center: Chat panel (primary, always visible)
  - Right: Editor panel (toggleable)
- Dynamic width calculation based on visible panels
- Smooth panel toggling with proper state management

### 4. Chat Functionality
- Real-time message sending and receiving
- Message type detection (user messages vs commands)
- Input field with live updates
- Support for streaming AI responses
- Auto-scrolling chat window (via JavaScript hook)

### 5. Keyboard Shortcuts
- Ctrl+F: Toggle file tree
- Ctrl+E: Toggle editor
- Ctrl+/: Focus chat input
- Global keyboard event handling via `phx-window-keydown`

### 6. Presence Tracking
- Integration with RubberDuckWeb.Presence
- Real-time user tracking in projects
- Periodic presence updates
- Visual representation of online users

### 7. Components
- Connection status indicator
- Panel toggle buttons
- User presence avatars
- Chat message display
- Streaming message animation
- Loading overlay
- Placeholder components for file tree and editor (to be implemented in later phases)

### 8. Router Configuration
- Added route: `/projects/:project_id/session`
- Configured within authenticated LiveView session

### 9. Testing Infrastructure
- Created ConnCase for LiveView testing
- Set up AccountsFixtures for user creation
- Implemented comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Authentication and redirects
  - Panel toggling
  - Chat functionality
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - PubSub message handling
  - Connection status
  - Streaming messages

### 10. JavaScript Hooks (Prepared)
- Created ChatScroll hook for auto-scrolling
- Created FocusChat hook for keyboard shortcut support
- Hooks ready for integration when main app.js is configured

## Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: Used socket assigns for all state, avoiding process state for simplicity and LiveView best practices

2. **Authentication**: Leveraged existing LiveUserAuth module with on_mount callback for consistent authentication

3. **PubSub Topics**: Separated concerns into three distinct topics for better message routing and filtering

4. **Layout Flexibility**: Made panels toggleable from the start to support different user preferences and screen sizes

5. **Placeholder Components**: Used placeholder components for file tree and editor to allow independent development of these features

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Testing Authentication**: AshAuthentication's policy system required special handling in tests. Created fixtures that bypass authorization for test data creation.

2. **Phoenix Test Configuration**: Needed to configure secret_key_base in test environment for session handling.

3. **JavaScript Integration**: The project doesn't have a main app.js file yet, so JavaScript hooks are prepared but not integrated.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 12.2: Real-time collaboration features
2. Implement Phase 12.3: File tree component
3. Implement Phase 12.4: Editor integration
4. Set up JavaScript build pipeline for hooks
5. Add telemetry events for monitoring
6. Implement error recovery and reconnection logic

## Success Criteria Met

✅ LiveView loads and authenticates users properly
✅ All three panels (tree, chat, editor) render correctly
✅ Panel toggling works smoothly
✅ PubSub architecture established (ready for real-time updates)
✅ Keyboard shortcuts implemented
✅ Error states handled gracefully (redirects for unauthenticated users)
✅ Tests provide good coverage
✅ Accessibility features included (keyboard navigation, semantic HTML)

## Code Quality

- Followed existing patterns from StatusDashboardLive
- Used proper LiveView conventions
- Implemented comprehensive error handling
- Added detailed documentation
- Created reusable components
- Maintained consistent code style

The implementation successfully establishes a solid foundation for the collaborative coding interface, with all core infrastructure in place for future feature development.
