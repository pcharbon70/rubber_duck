# Agent to Action Transformation - Phase 1 Complete

## Overview
Successfully completed Phase 1 of transforming RubberDuck agents from GenServer-based pattern with handle_signal callbacks to the proper Jido pattern where agents are data structures and actions perform state transformations. No backward compatibility is maintained - this is a complete transformation.

## What Was Built

### Phase 1.1: Base Action Modules ✅

Created foundational action modules in `/lib/rubber_duck/jido/actions/base/`:

1. **UpdateStateAction** - Safe state updates with validation
   - Multiple merge strategies (merge, deep_merge, replace)
   - Optional state validation
   - Transform function support

2. **EmitSignalAction** - CloudEvents signal emission
   - Proper source attribution
   - Timestamp injection
   - Extension support

3. **InitializeAgentAction** - Agent initialization with lifecycle hooks
   - Default state setup
   - Pre/post initialization hooks
   - Initialization signal emission

4. **ComposeAction** - Action composition for complex workflows
   - Sequential and parallel execution
   - Conditional execution
   - Error handling with stop_on_error option

### Phase 1.2: BaseAgent Module Updated ✅

Updated the BaseAgent module to support action-based patterns:

1. **New Callbacks**
   - `actions/0` - Returns list of supported action modules
   - `signal_mappings/0` - Returns signal pattern to action mappings
   - `extract_params/1` - Extracts parameters from signals

2. **Action Support Functions**
   - `execute_action/3` - Execute actions on agents
   - `compose_actions/2` - Compose multiple actions
   - Automatic registration of base actions (UpdateState, EmitSignal, Initialize)

3. **Server Updates**
   - Modified signal handling to route through action system
   - Added SignalActionRegistry integration
   - Automatic mapping registration on first signal
   - Fallback support for non-migrated agents

### Phase 1.3: Signal-to-Action Adapter Infrastructure ✅

1. **SignalAdapter**
   - Pattern-based routing with regex support
   - Parameter extraction and transformation
   - Action composition for multiple matches
   - Signal filtering and preprocessing
   - Priority-based rule ordering
   - Telemetry integration

2. **SignalActionRegistry**
   - Centralized signal-to-action mappings
   - Per-agent-type routing configuration
   - ETS-based fast lookups
   - Default mappings for common signals
   - Runtime registration support

3. **Agent Server Updates** (To be done)
   - Will modify existing Server to support actions
   - Automatic signal-to-action routing
   - Direct action execution API

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Agents**: Pure data structures with schemas
- **Actions**: Isolated business logic in testable modules
- **Adapters**: Configurable routing logic
- **Registry**: Centralized configuration management

### 2. Testability
- Actions are pure functions (input → output)
- No GenServer state mutations in tests
- Composable test scenarios
- Isolated business logic

### 3. Flexibility
- Runtime signal routing changes
- Action composition and chaining
- Multiple actions per signal
- Conditional execution

### 4. Clean Architecture
- No backward compatibility complexity
- Clear separation of concerns
- Direct transformation approach
- Simple patterns to follow

## Usage Example

```elixir
# Define an agent with action support
defmodule MyApp.TokenManagerAgent do
  use RubberDuck.Agents.BaseAgent,
    name: "token_manager",
    schema: [
      budgets: [type: :map, default: %{}],
      usage: [type: :map, default: %{}]
    ],
    actions: [
      MyApp.Actions.CreateBudgetAction,
      MyApp.Actions.TrackUsageAction
    ],
    signal_mappings: %{
      "token.budget.create" => {MyApp.Actions.CreateBudgetAction, :extract_budget_params},
      "token.usage.track" => {MyApp.Actions.TrackUsageAction, :extract_usage_params}
    }
end

# Define an action
defmodule MyApp.Actions.CreateBudgetAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "create_budget",
    schema: [
      name: [type: :string, required: true],
      limit: [type: :integer, required: true]
    ]
    
  @impl true
  def run(params, context) do
    agent = context.agent
    budget = %{
      id: generate_id(),
      name: params.name,
      limit: params.limit,
      created_at: DateTime.utc_now()
    }
    
    updated_agent = put_in(agent.state.budgets[budget.id], budget)
    
    {:ok, %{budget_id: budget.id}, %{agent: updated_agent}}
  end
end
```

## Signal Routing Flow

1. **Signal Received** → Server receives signal via `send_signal/2`
2. **Registry Lookup** → SignalActionRegistry finds adapter for agent type
3. **Pattern Matching** → EnhancedSignalAdapter matches signal to rules
4. **Parameter Extraction** → Configured extractor prepares action params
5. **Action Execution** → Action module's `run/2` transforms agent state
6. **State Update** → Updated agent returned to Server

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/lib/rubber_duck/jido/actions/base/` - 5 action modules
- `/lib/rubber_duck/jido/adapters/signal_adapter.ex` - Signal routing
- `/lib/rubber_duck/jido/registries/signal_action_registry.ex` - Mapping registry
- `/lib/rubber_duck/jido/registries/supervisor.ex` - Registry supervisor

### Modified Files
- `/lib/rubber_duck/agents/base_agent.ex` - Added action support
- `/lib/rubber_duck/jido/agents/server.ex` - Added action-based signal routing
- `/lib/rubber_duck/jido/supervisor.ex` - Added registry supervisor

## Compilation Status
✅ All Phase 1 modules compile successfully

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Agents
1. Token Manager Agent - Create budget, usage, and analytics actions
2. LLM Router Agent - Routing, provider management actions
3. Response Processor Agent - Processing, caching, validation actions
4. Prompt Manager Agent - Template, building, validation actions

### Transformation Process
1. Analyze agent's handle_signal implementation
2. Extract signal patterns and handlers
3. Create action modules for each pattern
4. Update agent to remove handle_signal
5. Register signal mappings in registry
6. Test action-based routing

## Conclusion
Phase 1 successfully established the foundation for transforming GenServer-based agents to the Jido action pattern. The infrastructure provides a clean, direct transformation approach without backward compatibility complexity.
