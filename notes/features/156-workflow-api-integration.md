# Feature 15.1.6: Workflow API Integration

## Summary
Provide comprehensive API integration for the Reactor workflow system, enabling external systems to create, manage, monitor, and interact with agent workflows through RESTful APIs, WebSocket connections, and GraphQL endpoints. This feature transforms our internal workflow orchestration into a platform that can be consumed by web applications, mobile apps, and other microservices.

## Problem Statement
With the robust Reactor workflow integration now in place (15.1.5), we need to expose these capabilities to external consumers. The current system provides:
- Advanced workflow orchestration with Reactor
- Comprehensive monitoring and telemetry
- Persistent workflow state management
- Rich workflow library patterns

However, these capabilities are only accessible internally. External systems need:
- RESTful APIs to trigger and manage workflows
- Real-time updates on workflow progress via WebSockets
- Comprehensive API documentation and developer tools
- Proper authentication, authorization, and rate limiting
- GraphQL endpoints for flexible data queries

## Solution Overview
Create a comprehensive API layer that exposes workflow capabilities to external consumers:
1. Build RESTful endpoints for workflow CRUD operations and execution
2. Implement WebSocket connections for real-time workflow event streaming
3. Add robust authentication, authorization, and rate limiting
4. Generate comprehensive API documentation with interactive tools
5. Provide GraphQL endpoints for flexible workflow and monitoring data queries

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: RESTful Workflow API (15.1.6.1)
**Core API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/v1/workflows` - Create and start workflows
- `GET /api/v1/workflows` - List workflows with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/v1/workflows/:id` - Get workflow details and status
- `PUT /api/v1/workflows/:id` - Update workflow parameters (if running)
- `DELETE /api/v1/workflows/:id` - Cancel/stop workflow execution
- `POST /api/v1/workflows/:id/resume` - Resume halted workflows
- `GET /api/v1/workflows/:id/logs` - Retrieve workflow execution logs

**Library and Template APIs**
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-templates` - List available workflow library templates
- `GET /api/v1/workflow-templates/:name` - Get template details and schema
- `POST /api/v1/workflows/from-template/:name` - Create workflow from template

**Agent Integration APIs**
- `GET /api/v1/agents` - List available agents with capabilities
- `GET /api/v1/agents/:id/status` - Get agent status and load information
- `POST /api/v1/workflows/:id/steps/:step/retry` - Retry failed workflow steps

### Phase 2: WebSocket Workflow Events (15.1.6.2)
**Real-time Event Streaming**
- `ws://host/api/v1/workflows/:id/events` - Subscribe to specific workflow events
- `ws://host/api/v1/workflows/events` - Subscribe to all workflow events with filtering
- `ws://host/api/v1/agents/events` - Subscribe to agent status and load changes

**Event Types**
- `workflow.started` - Workflow execution initiated
- `workflow.step.completed` - Individual step completion
- `workflow.step.failed` - Step failure with error details
- `workflow.paused` - Workflow paused/halted
- `workflow.resumed` - Workflow resumed from pause
- `workflow.completed` - Workflow finished successfully
- `workflow.failed` - Workflow terminated with errors
- `agent.selected` - Agent selected for step execution
- `agent.status.changed` - Agent availability/load changes

**WebSocket Message Format**
```json
{
  "event": "workflow.step.completed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "workflow_id": "wf_abc123",
  "step_name": "validate_input",
  "data": {
    "duration": 1250,
    "result": { "status": "valid", "data": "..." },
    "agent_id": "agent_validator_1"
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: API Authentication & Authorization (15.1.6.3)
**Authentication Mechanisms**
- API Key authentication for service-to-service calls
- JWT tokens for user-based authentication
- OAuth 2.0 integration for third-party applications
- mTLS support for high-security environments

**Authorization Framework**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for workflow operations
- Resource-based permissions (workflow ownership, agent access)
- Scope-based API access (read-only, workflow-management, admin)
- Integration with existing RubberDuck authentication system

**Security Headers and Middleware**
- CORS configuration for web application integration
- Rate limiting with Redis-based counters
- Request validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for all API operations

### Phase 4: Workflow API Documentation (15.1.6.4)
**Interactive Documentation**
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification generation
- Swagger UI integration for interactive API exploration
- Code generation tools for client libraries (Python, JavaScript, Go)
- Postman collection exports for testing

**Developer Tools**
- Workflow visualization dashboard accessible via web
- API playground for testing workflow creation and execution
- WebSocket event inspector for real-time debugging
- Comprehensive guides and tutorials

**Documentation Content**
- Getting started guide with example workflows
- Authentication and authorization setup
- Webhook integration patterns
- Error handling and troubleshooting
- Performance optimization recommendations

### Phase 5: API Rate Limiting & Monitoring (15.1.6.5)
**Rate Limiting Implementation**
- Per-API-key rate limits with Redis backend
- Sliding window rate limiting algorithm
- Different limits for different endpoint categories
- Graceful degradation and queuing for burst traffic

**API Monitoring & Analytics**
- Request/response metrics collection via telemetry
- API performance monitoring with response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring and alerting
- Usage analytics and reporting dashboard

**Health Checks and Status**
- `GET /api/v1/health` - API health status
- `GET /api/v1/status` - System status including agent availability
- `GET /api/v1/metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint

## Implementation Dependencies
- **Phoenix Framework**: Web framework for API endpoints
- **Phoenix.PubSub**: Real-time event broadcasting for WebSockets
- **Redix**: Redis client for rate limiting and caching
- **Guardian**: JWT authentication library
- **ExDoc**: Documentation generation
- **Corsica**: CORS middleware
- **OpenApiSpex**: OpenAPI specification generation

## Success Criteria
1. **Functional APIs**: All workflow operations accessible via REST
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket events for workflow progress
3. **Secure Access**: Proper authentication and authorization
4. **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive documentation and tools
5. **Production Ready**: Rate limiting, monitoring, and error handling
6. **Performance**: Sub-200ms API response times for typical operations
7. **Scalability**: Support for 1000+ concurrent workflow executions

## Backward Compatibility
- Internal workflow APIs remain unchanged
- All existing workflow patterns continue to work
- New API layer is additive, no breaking changes
- Existing telemetry and monitoring continue to function

## Future Considerations
- GraphQL endpoint implementation
- Webhook support for external system notifications
- Bulk workflow operations
- Workflow scheduling and cron-like capabilities
- Multi-tenant workflow isolation
- API versioning strategy for future enhancements

This feature transforms our workflow orchestration system into a platform that can power complex automation across multiple applications and systems, while maintaining the robustness and monitoring capabilities we've built with the Reactor integration.
