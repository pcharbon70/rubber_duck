# Base Engine Behavior Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the base engine behavior infrastructure (section 2.2) that provides GenServer-based management for engines in the RubberDuck system, including support for engine pooling.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Engine.Server
GenServer wrapper for engine instances that handles:
- Request execution with configurable timeouts
- Health monitoring with periodic checks
- Telemetry event emission for observability
- Statistics tracking (request count, error count, uptime)
- Crash isolation using supervised tasks

### 2. Engine.Supervisor
DynamicSupervisor for engine processes providing:
- Lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)
- Fault tolerance with automatic restarts
- Runtime engine addition/removal
- Process registry integration
- Support for both single instances and pooled engines

### 3. Engine.CapabilityRegistry
Registry for engine discovery featuring:
- Capability-based engine indexing
- Engine configuration storage
- Running engine tracking
- Efficient lookup operations

### 4. Engine.Manager
High-level API offering:
- Engine loading from DSL modules
- Request routing by name or capability
- Multiple selection strategies (first, random, round-robin)
- Lifecycle management functions
- Health monitoring and statistics
- Transparent handling of pooled and single-instance engines

### 5. Engine.Pool
Poolboy integration for concurrent request handling:
- Configurable pool size and overflow settings
- Automatic worker checkout/checkin
- Pool health monitoring and metrics
- Telemetry integration for pool metrics

### 6. Engine.Pool.Worker
Worker module for pooled engines:
- Wraps Engine.Server instances
- Enables concurrent request processing
- Maintains all Engine.Server functionality

## Features Delivered

- **Fault Tolerance**: Supervised execution with automatic recovery
- **Performance**: Concurrent request handling with timeouts
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic engine loading and capability-based routing
- **Observability**: Comprehensive telemetry and health monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and detailed error reporting
- **Concurrency**: Engine pooling for high-throughput scenarios

## Pooling Configuration

Engines can be configured with pooling in the DSL:

```elixir
engine :my_engine do
  module MyEngine
  pool_size 5          # 5 worker instances
  max_overflow 10      # Up to 10 extra workers under load
  checkout_timeout 5000 # Wait up to 5s for a worker
end
```

## Testing Results

- Created comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Integration tests demonstrate end-to-end functionality
- Pool tests verify concurrent request handling
- Example engines (echo, reverse) fully functional
- All pool tests passing after fixes

## Usage Example

```elixir
# Load engines
Manager.load_engines(MyApp.Engines)

# Execute requests (works for both pooled and single engines)
{:ok, result} = Manager.execute(:my_engine, %{input: "data"})
{:ok, result} = Manager.execute_by_capability(:text_processing, %{text: "Hello"})

# Monitor health
status = Manager.status(:my_engine)
# Single: %{engine: :my_engine, status: :ready, request_count: 42, ...}
# Pooled: %{pool_size: 5, available_workers: 3, checked_out: 2, ...}

# Manage lifecycle
Manager.stop_engine(:my_engine)
Manager.restart_engine(:my_engine)
```

## Technical Decisions

1. **DynamicSupervisor over Supervisor**: Allows runtime engine management
2. **Separate Process Registry**: Enables named process lookup
3. **Capability Registry as GenServer**: Maintains engine metadata and indexes
4. **Task-based Execution**: Provides timeout and crash isolation
5. **Telemetry Integration**: Enables production monitoring
6. **Poolboy for Pooling**: Industry-standard, battle-tested pooling library

## Known Limitations

- Engine restart requires configuration to be re-registered
- Basic health check implementation (can be extended)
- Simple selection strategies (can be enhanced for production)
- Pool configuration is static (no dynamic resizing yet)

## Future Enhancements

- Persistent engine configuration storage
- Advanced health check strategies
- Sophisticated load balancing
- Dynamic pool resizing based on load
- Circuit breaker integration for failing engines
- Distributed engine execution support

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `lib/rubber_duck/engine/supervisor.ex`
- `lib/rubber_duck/engine/capability_registry.ex`
- `lib/rubber_duck/engine/manager.ex`
- `lib/rubber_duck/engine/pool.ex`
- `lib/rubber_duck/engine/pool/worker.ex`
- `test/rubber_duck/engine/*.exs` (test files)
- `docs/base_engine_behavior.md`

### Modified Files
- `lib/rubber_duck/application.ex` (added engine components to supervision tree)

## Conclusion

The base engine behavior system is fully operational and provides a robust foundation for building pluggable engines. It successfully extends the Spark DSL foundation with runtime engine management, fault tolerance, comprehensive monitoring capabilities, and support for concurrent request handling through pooling. The system is ready for production use with appropriate configuration.
