# MCP Server Core Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the core Model Context Protocol (MCP) server infrastructure for RubberDuck, enabling standardized communication with external AI systems and tools using JSON-RPC 2.0.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Server (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/server.ex`)
- GenServer-based MCP server managing connections and protocol state
- Handles multiple concurrent sessions with proper isolation
- Supports connection lifecycle management and graceful shutdown
- Implements protocol version negotiation and capability advertisement

### 2. Transport Layer
- **Transport Behavior** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/transport.ex`): Defines callbacks for transport implementations
- **STDIO Transport** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/transport/stdio.ex`): Implements standard I/O transport for CLI integration
- Supports future addition of WebSocket and HTTP transports

### 3. Protocol Handler (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/protocol.ex`)
- Complete JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation with request/response/notification support
- Message parsing and validation with proper error handling
- Support for batch requests
- MCP-specific error codes alongside standard JSON-RPC errors

### 4. Session Management
- **Session** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/session.ex`): Per-connection state management with request handling
- **SessionSupervisor** (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/session_supervisor.ex`): DynamicSupervisor for fault isolation
- Request tracking with timeout handling
- Subscription management for tools and resources

### 5. Bridge to RubberDuck (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/bridge.ex`)
- Connects MCP protocol to RubberDuck's internal tool system
- Exposes tools, resources, and prompts in MCP format
- Handles parameter conversion and result formatting
- Provides workspace and memory resources

### 6. Capability System (`lib/rubber_duck/mcp/capability.ex`)
- Manages server capabilities and feature negotiation
- Protocol version compatibility checking
- Server information for initialization responses

## Test Coverage
- Protocol tests: Message parsing, building, and validation
- Server tests: Connection lifecycle, initialization, session management
- Mock transport for isolated testing

## Architecture Highlights

### Fault Tolerance
- Each session runs in its own supervised process
- Transport failures don't affect other sessions
- Graceful degradation on component failures

### Extensibility
- Transport behavior allows easy addition of new connection types
- Bridge pattern enables integration with existing RubberDuck tools
- Capability system supports feature discovery

### Performance
- Concurrent session handling with isolated state
- Efficient message routing through GenServer patterns
- Request correlation for async operations

## Integration Points

### Tool System
- Registry integration for tool discovery
- Executor integration for tool execution
- Parameter validation and conversion

### Memory System
- Memory resources exposed through MCP
- Session context preservation
- Pattern storage integration (stubbed for future implementation)

### Workspace
- Project resources available via MCP
- File access through resource URIs
- Real-time updates via subscriptions

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Add WebSocket transport for browser-based clients
2. Implement streaming response support
3. Add authentication and authorization
4. Complete memory system integration

### Future Enhancements
1. HTTP/SSE transport for REST clients
2. Tool composition through MCP
3. Advanced capability negotiation
4. Metrics and monitoring integration
5. Rate limiting and resource quotas

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No External Dependencies**: Removed jsonrpc2 dependency due to conflicts, implemented JSON-RPC handling directly
2. **Modular Transport**: Transport behavior allows multiple connection types without changing core logic
3. **Session Isolation**: Each client gets its own process for fault tolerance
4. **Bridge Pattern**: Cleanly separates MCP protocol from internal RubberDuck implementation

## Usage Example

```elixir
# Start MCP server with STDIO transport
{:ok, server} = RubberDuck.MCP.Server.start_link(
  transport: RubberDuck.MCP.Transport.STDIO,
  transport_opts: []
)

# Server automatically handles:
# - Client connections
# - Protocol initialization
# - Tool discovery and execution
# - Resource access
# - Graceful shutdown
```

## Conclusion

The MCP Server Core implementation provides a solid foundation for RubberDuck to communicate with external AI systems using the standardized Model Context Protocol. The architecture is fault-tolerant, extensible, and ready for production use with minimal additional work needed for authentication and remaining transports.
