# Feature 13.5: Project File Manager Implementation

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive file management system that provides secure, atomic file operations with collaborative features, search functionality, and extensive security validations. This builds upon the FileOperations module from 13.4 to provide a more complete file management solution.

## Goals
1. Create a context-aware FileManager module with project/user tracking
2. Implement atomic file operations with rollback support
3. Add comprehensive security features including virus scanning hooks
4. Build advanced search functionality with content search
5. Enable collaborative features with file locking and conflict detection

## Technical Design

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Core FileManager Module (`RubberDuck.Projects.FileManager`)
- Struct-based design with project and user context
- Integration with existing authorization system
- Comprehensive operation logging
- Error handling with detailed error types
- Transaction support for atomic operations

#### 2. Enhanced File Operations
- **read_file/2**: Secure file reading with streaming support
- **write_file/3**: Atomic writes with temporary file and rename
- **delete_file/2**: Soft delete with trash/recycle bin support
- **create_directory/2**: Recursive directory creation
- **list_directory/2**: Paginated directory listing with sorting
- **move_file/3**: Atomic file/directory moving
- **copy_file/3**: Efficient file copying with progress tracking

#### 3. Security Layer
- File size validation with configurable limits
- Content type detection and validation
- Virus scanning hook interface
- Encryption support for sensitive files
- Comprehensive audit trail with Ecto integration
- Checksum verification for file integrity

#### 4. Search System
- Pattern-based file name search
- File type and extension filtering
- Full-text content search with indexing
- Search result ranking by relevance
- Search result caching with TTL
- Saved search queries per user

#### 5. Collaborative Features
- File modification tracking per user
- Pessimistic file locking mechanism
- Conflict detection for concurrent edits
- Three-way merge strategies
- Real-time change notifications via PubSub
- File version history tracking

### Key Features

#### Atomic Operations
```elixir
# All write operations use temporary files
1. Write to temp file
2. Validate written content
3. Set permissions
4. Atomic rename to target
5. Cleanup on failure
```

#### Security Validations
```elixir
- Path traversal prevention
- File size limits
- Extension whitelist/blacklist
- Content type verification
- Malware scanning integration
- Access control per operation
```

#### Search Capabilities
```elixir
- Glob pattern matching
- Regular expression search
- Content indexing with PostgreSQL full-text search
- Metadata search (size, date, type)
- Search within archives (zip, tar)
```

#### Collaboration Flow
```elixir
1. User requests file lock
2. System checks current locks
3. Grant lock with timeout
4. Track all changes
5. Release lock on completion
6. Notify other users
```

### Data Models

#### FileOperation Schema
```elixir
- id: UUID
- project_id: references(:projects)
- user_id: references(:users)
- operation: enum [:read, :write, :delete, :move, :copy]
- file_path: string
- metadata: map
- status: enum [:pending, :success, :failed]
- error_message: string
- performed_at: utc_datetime
```

#### FileLock Schema
```elixir
- id: UUID
- project_id: references(:projects)
- user_id: references(:users)
- file_path: string
- lock_type: enum [:exclusive, :shared]
- acquired_at: utc_datetime
- expires_at: utc_datetime
- released_at: utc_datetime
```

### Integration Points

1. **FileOperations Module**: Reuse path validation and basic operations
2. **WatcherManager**: Coordinate with file watching system
3. **ProjectFilesLive**: Provide operations for UI
4. **Security Audit**: Log all file operations
5. **Phoenix.PubSub**: Broadcast file changes and locks

2. Add streaming file read
3. Create trash/recycle system
4. Build directory operations
5. Add move/copy functionality

### Phase 3: Security Features
1. Implement size validation
2. Add content type detection
3. Create virus scan hooks
4. Build encryption layer
5. Integrate audit logging

### Phase 4: Search System
1. Create search index
2. Implement pattern search
3. Add content search
4. Build result ranking
5. Add search caching

### Phase 5: Collaboration
1. Create lock management
2. Implement conflict detection
3. Add merge strategies
4. Build notifications
5. Create version tracking

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- File operation atomicity
- Security validation edge cases
- Search accuracy and performance
- Lock management scenarios
- Error handling paths

### Integration Tests
- Multi-user file operations
- Search with real file systems
- Lock contention scenarios
- Notification delivery
- Audit trail accuracy

### Performance Tests
- Large file handling
- Concurrent operations
- Search index performance
- Lock contention impact

## Security Considerations
- All operations must validate project access
- Path traversal prevention at multiple layers
- File size DoS prevention
- Malware scanning for uploads
- Audit all operations
- Encrypt sensitive file metadata

## Future Enhancements
- Cloud storage backend support (S3, GCS)
- Advanced merge algorithms
- Real-time collaborative editing
- File compression/decompression
- Archive file handling
- OCR for image search
- AI-powered file organization
