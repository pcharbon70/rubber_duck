# Feature: Agentic Workflows Implementation (Section 4.5)

## Summary
Implement autonomous agent systems using OTP patterns for complex, multi-step reasoning and task execution. Build upon the completed workflow foundation (Sections 4.1-4.4) to create intelligent agents that can collaborate, delegate tasks, and perform sophisticated code analysis and generation workflows.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create agent supervision tree with DynamicSupervisor for fault-tolerant agent management
- [ ] Implement base Agent behavior with lifecycle callbacks and state management
- [ ] Build specialized agents: Research, Analysis, Generation, and Review agents
- [ ] Develop agent coordination system for task delegation and result aggregation
- [ ] Implement inter-agent communication protocols with broadcast and point-to-point messaging
- [ ] Create shared memory system for agent collaboration and context sharing
- [ ] Add agent health monitoring and performance metrics
- [ ] Integrate agents with existing workflow system (Reactor-based)
- [ ] Support agent learning and adaptation capabilities
- [ ] Build agent registry for discovery and metadata management

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- OTP patterns: Robust DynamicSupervisor + Registry pattern already established
- Workflow system: Advanced Reactor-based workflows with compensation support
- Memory management: Three-tier system (short/mid/long-term) with semantic capabilities
- Communication: MessageBus with pub/sub and request/response patterns
- LLM integration: Complete service layer with multiple providers and fallback

### Documentation Reviewed
- Engine supervisor patterns: DynamicSupervisor with fault tolerance (3 restarts/5s)
- Registry usage: Multiple registries with process discovery and cleanup
- GenServer patterns: State management, monitoring, and health checks
- Workflow integration: Reactor DSL with dependency resolution and parallel execution
- Memory coordination: ETS-based caching with TTL and automatic migration

### Existing Patterns Found
- Pattern 1: [lib/rubber_duck/engine/supervisor.ex:15] - DynamicSupervisor with Registry
- Pattern 2: [lib/rubber_duck/workflows/executor.ex:25] - GenServer orchestration
- Pattern 3: [lib/rubber_duck/memory/manager.ex:40] - State coordination with ETS
- Pattern 4: [lib/rubber_duck/message_bus.ex:60] - Pub/sub communication patterns

### Technical Approach
1. **Agent Supervision Tree**:
   - Use DynamicSupervisor pattern similar to Engine.Supervisor
   - Implement Registry for agent discovery and metadata
   - Add Coordinator GenServer for orchestration and task delegation

2. **Base Agent Architecture**:
   - Define Agent behavior with standard lifecycle callbacks
   - Implement state management using GenServer patterns
   - Add communication protocol for inter-agent messaging
   - Support memory sharing through existing Memory.Manager

3. **Specialized Agents**:
   - **Research Agent**: Information gathering, context building, semantic search
   - **Analysis Agent**: Code analysis using existing engines, pattern detection
   - **Generation Agent**: Code generation, refactoring, enhancement suggestions
   - **Review Agent**: Quality assessment, validation, feedback generation

4. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Extend Reactor workflow system to support agentic steps
   - Leverage existing LLM.Service for agent reasoning capabilities
   - Use MessageBus for agent communication and coordination
   - Integrate with Memory.Manager for shared context and learning

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Agent communication complexity | High | Use proven MessageBus patterns, implement simple protocols first |
| Memory coordination conflicts | Medium | Leverage existing Memory.Manager, implement agent-specific namespaces |
| Performance with multiple agents | Medium | Implement agent pooling, monitor resource usage, use backpressure |
| Agent coordination deadlocks | High | Use timeout-based coordination, implement circuit breakers |
| Integration with existing workflows | Medium | Build incremental integration, maintain backward compatibility |

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should agents be implemented as separate processes or as workflow steps?
2. What level of autonomy should agents have (fully autonomous vs. human-guided)?
3. Should we implement agent learning capabilities in this phase or defer to later?
4. How should agents handle conflicting recommendations or analysis results?
5. What metrics and monitoring should we implement for agent performance?
