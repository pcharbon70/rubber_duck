# Section 15.4.6: LLM Infrastructure Unit Tests

## Overview
This section implements comprehensive unit tests for the LLM infrastructure agents created in sections 15.4.1 through 15.4.5. These tests ensure the reliability, performance, and correctness of the LLM routing, provider integration, prompt management, response processing, and token tracking systems.

## Goals
1. Test all LLM infrastructure agents with comprehensive coverage
2. Verify routing logic and failover mechanisms
3. Ensure provider integration works correctly
4. Validate prompt management and templating
5. Test response processing pipelines
6. Verify token tracking and budget enforcement

## Implementation Plan

### 1. LLM Router Agent Tests
- Test routing decision logic
- Verify load balancing strategies
- Test failover and circuit breaker mechanisms
- Validate provider selection based on capabilities
- Test metrics collection and reporting

### 2. Provider Agent Tests
- Test OpenAI provider integration
- Test Anthropic provider integration
- Test local model provider integration
- Verify streaming response handling
- Test error handling and retries

### 3. Prompt Manager Agent Tests
- Test template storage and retrieval
- Verify variable substitution
- Test A/B testing functionality
- Validate prompt optimization
- Test version management

### 4. Response Processor Agent Tests
- Test parsing for different formats
- Verify validation logic
- Test enhancement pipeline
- Validate caching mechanisms
- Test streaming processing

### 5. Token Manager Agent Tests
- Verify usage tracking accuracy
- Test budget enforcement
- Validate cost calculations
- Test analytics generation
- Verify persistence integration

## Technical Approach
- Use ExUnit for test framework
- Create test helpers for common scenarios
- Use mocks for external provider APIs
- Test both success and failure paths
- Ensure tests are deterministic and fast

## Success Criteria
- All agents have >90% test coverage
- Tests are fast and reliable
- Edge cases are properly handled
- Integration points are verified
- Performance characteristics are validated
