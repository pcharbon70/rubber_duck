# Feature 13.2: Dynamic File Watcher Infrastructure

## Overview
Implement a robust file watching system that monitors file changes within project sandboxes, providing real-time notifications while maintaining security boundaries. This system will use OTP supervision patterns for reliability and Phoenix PubSub for efficient event distribution.

## Goals
1. Create a supervised file watcher system for project directories
2. Implement efficient event batching and debouncing
3. Integrate with Phoenix PubSub for real-time notifications
4. Ensure all file watching respects project sandbox boundaries
5. Provide graceful lifecycle management and error recovery

## Technical Design

### Architecture Components

#### 1. File Watcher Supervisor (`RubberDuck.Projects.FileWatcher.Supervisor`)
- DynamicSupervisor for managing multiple file watchers
- One-for-one supervision strategy
- Automatic restart on crashes
- Registry-based process tracking

#### 2. Project File Watcher (`RubberDuck.Projects.FileWatcher`)
- GenServer for watching a single project directory
- Uses FileSystem library for OS-level file monitoring
- Validates all paths against project sandbox
- Configurable event filtering and debouncing

#### 3. Event Processing System
- Event batching with configurable buffer sizes
- Debouncing with configurable intervals (default 100ms)
- Event type categorization (created, modified, deleted, renamed)
- Path validation using existing FileAccess and SymlinkSecurity modules

#### 4. PubSub Integration
- Project-specific topics: `file_watcher:project:#{project_id}`
- Event aggregation before broadcasting
- Subscriber management with presence tracking
- Efficient broadcast patterns to minimize overhead

### Data Flow
1. FileSystem detects OS-level file change
2. FileWatcher validates path against project sandbox
3. Event is categorized and added to batch buffer
4. Debounce timer aggregates rapid changes
5. Batch is broadcast via PubSub to subscribers
6. Security audit logs file access patterns

### Security Considerations
- All paths validated through FileAccess module
- Symlink detection via SymlinkSecurity module
- Events filtered to prevent information leakage
- Access patterns logged to SecurityAudit
- Rate limiting on event broadcasts

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create FileWatcher.Supervisor with DynamicSupervisor
2. Implement basic FileWatcher GenServer
3. Add Registry-based process tracking
4. Create start_link and child_spec functions

### Phase 2: Event Processing
1. Implement event batching logic
2. Add debouncing with timers
3. Create event type categorization
4. Integrate path validation

### Phase 3: PubSub Integration
1. Define topic structure
2. Implement broadcast functions
3. Add subscriber management
4. Create presence tracking

### Phase 4: Lifecycle Management
1. Implement graceful shutdown
2. Add crash recovery logic
3. Create health monitoring
4. Build telemetry integration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- FileWatcher lifecycle (start/stop/restart)
- Event batching and debouncing logic
- Path validation and security checks
- PubSub message delivery
- Error recovery mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- Multiple concurrent watchers
- High-frequency file changes
- Symlink attack prevention
- Cross-project isolation
- System resource usage

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient OS-level file monitoring
- Batched event processing
- Debounced broadcasts
- Memory-efficient buffer management
- CPU usage monitoring

## Dependencies
- FileSystem library (already included)
- Phoenix.PubSub (already included)
- Existing security modules (FileAccess, SymlinkSecurity)

## API Examples

### Starting a Watcher
```elixir
{:ok, pid} = RubberDuck.Projects.FileWatcher.Supervisor.start_watcher(project_id, %{
  root_path: "/projects/my_project",
  debounce_ms: 100,
  batch_size: 50
})
```

### Subscribing to Events
```elixir
Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(RubberDuck.PubSub, "file_watcher:project:#{project_id}")

# Receive messages like:
%{
  event: :file_changed,
  changes: [
    %{path: "src/main.ex", type: :modified, timestamp: ~U[2024-07-23 10:00:00Z]},
    %{path: "test/main_test.ex", type: :created, timestamp: ~U[2024-07-23 10:00:01Z]}
  ]
}
```

### Stopping a Watcher
```elixir
:ok = RubberDuck.Projects.FileWatcher.Supervisor.stop_watcher(project_id)
```

## Future Enhancements
- Pattern-based file filtering
- Custom event handlers
- Integration with code analysis
- File change diffing
- Distributed file watching
