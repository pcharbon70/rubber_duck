# Feature: Core Status Broadcasting Infrastructure

## Summary
Implement a high-performance, non-blocking status message broadcasting system using GenServer with intelligent batching and queue management for real-time status updates.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create StatusBroadcaster GenServer with configurable queue limits (10,000 messages)
- [ ] Implement batch processing with configurable batch size (100 messages)
- [ ] Add periodic flush timer mechanism (50ms intervals)
- [ ] Implement overflow handling with message dropping and logging
- [ ] Use Task.Supervisor for asynchronous broadcast execution
- [ ] Create PubSub topic structure for conversation/category routing
- [ ] Add telemetry events for queue depth, batch size, and broadcast latency
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown handling for pending messages
- [ ] Add configuration options for queue limits, batch size, and flush interval
- [ ] Create fire-and-forget Status API module for system-wide usage

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Phoenix.PubSub: Already configured in application as RubberDuck.PubSub
- Task.Supervisor: Already configured as RubberDuck.TaskSupervisor
- GenServer patterns: Found in MessageQueue, MCPConnectionManager, etc.

### Documentation Reviewed
- Erlang :queue module: Efficient FIFO implementation for message queuing
- Phoenix.PubSub: Broadcasting system already in use for MCP channels
- Task.Supervisor: Used for async operations in tool executor

### Existing Patterns Found
- GenServer pattern: lib/rubber_duck_web/channels/message_queue.ex:8
- Task.Supervisor usage: lib/rubber_duck/tool/executor.ex:107
- PubSub broadcasting: lib/rubber_duck_web/channels/mcp_channel.ex:117
- Application supervision: lib/rubber_duck/application.ex:54-56
- Telemetry events: lib/rubber_duck/telemetry/ash_handler.ex:36

### Technical Approach
1. Create StatusBroadcaster GenServer following MessageQueue pattern
2. Use Erlang :queue for efficient FIFO operations
3. Implement batch processing similar to research design
4. Integrate with existing Task.Supervisor for async broadcasts
5. Use Phoenix.PubSub with topic pattern: "status:{conversation_id}:{category}"
6. Add telemetry events following Ash handler patterns
7. Add to application supervision tree after Task.Supervisor
8. Create Status API module as public interface

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Queue overflow under high load | High | Implement configurable limits with dropping and logging |
| Memory leak from unbounded growth | High | Track queue size, enforce limits, add telemetry alerts |
| Broadcast failures blocking queue | Medium | Use fire-and-forget with Task.Supervisor isolation |
| Message ordering issues | Low | Use :queue for FIFO, process batches in order |
| Configuration changes requiring restart | Low | Plan for dynamic updates in future iteration |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create lib/rubber_duck/status/broadcaster.ex GenServer module
- [ ] Create lib/rubber_duck/status.ex public API module
- [ ] Add StatusBroadcaster to application supervision tree
- [ ] Add configuration options in config/config.exs
- [ ] Create test file test/rubber_duck/status/broadcaster_test.exs
- [ ] Implement queue management with :queue
- [ ] Implement batch processing logic
- [ ] Integrate with Phoenix.PubSub
- [ ] Add telemetry events
- [ ] Test queue overflow scenarios
- [ ] Test graceful shutdown
- [ ] Verify no performance impact on main flow

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we add message deduplication within batches?
2. Do you want configurable message TTL for future persistence?
3. Should categories be validated against a whitelist?
4. Do you need message priority levels for future enhancements?
