# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: Enhanced Operations

## Completed Tasks

### 1. File Cache System (FileCache)
- Created ETS-based caching system with project-based partitioning
- Implemented TTL management with configurable expiration
- Added pattern-based cache invalidation with wildcard support
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Cache statistics tracking (size, memory, hit rate)
- Full test coverage with 10 passing tests

### 2. FileManager Cache Integration
- Added caching support to `list_directory` operations
- Cache keys include directory path and query options (page, sort, etc.)
- Configurable caching with `enable_cache` option (default: true)
- Automatic cache invalidation on file operations:
  - Write operations invalidate parent directory
  - Delete operations invalidate parent directory
  - Move operations invalidate both source and destination
  - Copy operations invalidate destination directory
  - Directory creation invalidates parent

### 3. FileManagerWatcher Integration
- Created FileManagerWatcher module for automatic cache invalidation
- Subscribes to FileWatcher events via PubSub
- Automatically invalidates cache when files change externally
- Dynamic supervisor for per-project watcher processes
- Auto-start capability with `auto_watch` option (default: true)

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Directory listings are cached to reduce file system access
- Cache invalidation is targeted to minimize unnecessary evictions
- Pattern-based invalidation allows efficient bulk operations
- Concurrent read/write support through ETS

## Key Features Implemented

### Cache Operations
```elixir
# Basic cache operations
FileCache.put(project_id, path, value, ttl: :timer.minutes(5))
{:ok, value} = FileCache.get(project_id, path)
FileCache.invalidate(project_id, path)

# Pattern invalidation
FileCache.invalidate_pattern(project_id, "dir/*")     # Single level
FileCache.invalidate_pattern(project_id, "dir/**")    # Recursive
FileCache.invalidate_pattern(project_id, "list:.:*")  # All root listings
```

### FileManager Integration
```elixir
# Caching is automatic and transparent
fm = FileManager.new(project, user, 
  enable_cache: true,    # Enable caching
  auto_watch: true       # Auto-start file watcher
)

# First call hits file system
{:ok, entries} = FileManager.list_directory(fm, ".")  # Cache miss

# Subsequent calls use cache
{:ok, entries} = FileManager.list_directory(fm, ".")  # Cache hit

# File operations automatically invalidate cache
{:ok, _} = FileManager.write_file(fm, "new.txt", "content")
{:ok, entries} = FileManager.list_directory(fm, ".")  # Cache miss, reloaded
```

### Cache Statistics
```elixir
stats = FileCache.stats()
# %{
#   size: 42,
#   memory: 8192,
#   hits: 100,
#   misses: 20,
#   evictions: 5,
#   hit_rate: 83.33,
#   last_cleanup: ~U[2024-01-20 10:30:00Z]
# }
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suites:
- `file_cache_test.exs` - 10 tests for cache operations
- `file_manager_cache_test.exs` - 12 tests for integration
- All 22 tests passing

Test coverage includes:
- Basic cache operations (get, put, invalidate)
- TTL expiration
- Pattern-based invalidation
- Cache isolation by project
- Automatic invalidation on file operations
- Performance with pagination and sorting

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Performance**: Reduces file system access for frequently accessed directories
2. **Scalability**: ETS provides concurrent read access
3. **Consistency**: Automatic invalidation ensures cache freshness
4. **Flexibility**: Configurable caching and TTL per operation
5. **Monitoring**: Built-in statistics for cache performance analysis

## Integration with Existing Systems

- FileCache is added to application supervision tree
- FileManagerWatcher integrates with existing FileWatcher system
- Cache invalidation happens transparently during file operations
- No changes required to existing FileManager API

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Security Features
- Implement virus scanning hooks
- Add file content validation
- Create encryption support for sensitive files
- Build comprehensive audit trail with database persistence
- Add file integrity checking with checksums

### Phase 4: Search Functionality
- Implement pattern-based file search
- Add content indexing with PostgreSQL full-text search
- Create search result ranking and relevance scoring
- Build search caching with incremental updates
- Add saved searches per user

### Phase 5: Collaboration
- Implement file locking mechanism
- Add conflict detection for concurrent edits
- Create merge strategies for text files
- Build real-time notifications for file changes
- Add version history tracking

## Performance Considerations

- Cache size should be monitored in production
- TTL values should be tuned based on usage patterns
- Consider implementing cache warming for frequently accessed directories
- Monitor cache hit rates to ensure effectiveness
- Plan for distributed caching if scaling to multiple nodes
