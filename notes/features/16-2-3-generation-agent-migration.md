# Feature: Generation Agent Migration (16.2.3)

## Summary
Migrate the existing GenerationAgent from legacy RubberDuck.Agents.Behavior to Jido.Agent patterns, extracting all business logic into reusable Actions and implementing streaming support through signals.

## Requirements
- [ ] Replace legacy behavior with BaseAgent following established patterns
- [ ] Extract generation logic into Actions (CodeGenerationAction, TemplateRenderAction, etc.)
- [ ] Implement streaming support through signals for real-time generation feedback
- [ ] Add template management and versioning system
- [ ] Create quality validation pipeline for generated code
- [ ] Maintain all existing functionality (generate, refactor, fix, complete, docs)
- [ ] Follow Jido pure function patterns with tagged tuple returns
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and state validation
- [ ] Support signal-based communication for event-driven architecture
- [ ] Ensure security through code validation and template sandboxing

## Research Summary

### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Jido framework: Pure functions, tagged tuples, schema validation, OTP integration
- BaseAgent patterns: State schema, signal mappings, action composition
- Existing migrations: AnalysisAgent provides successful migration template

### Documentation Reviewed
- GenerationAgent: Complex legacy behavior with 5 task types, cache, metrics, LLM integration
- Engines.Generation: RAG-based generation engine with templates and validation
- Jido patterns: Action-based architecture, Agent state management, Signal processing

### Existing Patterns Found
- AnalysisAgent: lib/rubber_duck/agents/analysis_agent.ex:47 - Successful BaseAgent migration
- Actions: lib/rubber_duck/jido/actions/analysis/*.ex - Jido Action implementations
- BaseAgent: lib/rubber_duck/agents/base_agent.ex - Agent framework wrapper

### Technical Approach

#### Phase 1: Agent Migration
1. **Replace Behavior with BaseAgent**: Convert from `use RubberDuck.Agents.Behavior` to `use RubberDuck.Agents.BaseAgent`
2. **Define State Schema**: Extract current state into validated schema (cache, preferences, metrics, history)
3. **Implement Signal Mappings**: Map generation signals to appropriate actions
4. **Preserve Capabilities**: Maintain existing capability reporting

#### Phase 2: Action Extraction
1. **CodeGenerationAction**: Core code generation with RAG context
2. **TemplateRenderAction**: Template-based code rendering 
3. **QualityValidationAction**: Validate generated code for syntax/security
4. **StreamingGenerationAction**: Real-time streaming generation with progress signals
5. **PostProcessingAction**: Format, optimize, and finalize generated code

#### Phase 3: Enhancement Features
1. **Template Management**: Version control and template library
2. **Streaming Support**: Real-time generation progress via signals
3. **Quality Pipeline**: Multi-stage validation and improvement

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing API | High | Maintain backward compatibility through adapter layer |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Benchmark and optimize action execution overhead |
| Complex state migration | Medium | Gradual migration with fallback to legacy behavior |
| Template security issues | High | Implement sandboxed template execution |
| Signal complexity | Low | Follow established patterns from AnalysisAgent |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create feature branch feature/16.2.3-generation-agent-migration
- [ ] Create Actions (CodeGenerationAction, TemplateRenderAction, QualityValidationAction, StreamingGenerationAction, PostProcessingAction)
- [ ] Migrate GenerationAgent to BaseAgent pattern
- [ ] Implement signal mappings for generation workflows
- [ ] Add template management system
- [ ] Implement streaming generation with progress signals
- [ ] Create quality validation pipeline
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all components
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Update documentation and examples

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we maintain backward compatibility for existing task-based API alongside new signal-based API?
2. What security requirements exist for template execution and code validation?
3. Are there specific streaming requirements or protocols to follow?
4. Should we integrate with existing Generation Engine or refactor it as Actions?
