# Feature: Short-Term Memory Agent

## Summary
Implement a Jido Agent that manages fast access to recent conversation memory using in-memory storage with automatic expiration, compression, and optimized access patterns.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create RubberDuck.Agents.ShortTermMemoryAgent using proper Jido.Agent patterns
- [ ] Implement in-memory storage using ETS tables for fast access
- [ ] Add indexing capabilities for efficient search operations
- [ ] Implement TTL-based expiration and automatic cleanup policies
- [ ] Create compression mechanisms for memory optimization
- [ ] Build read optimization with caching layers and prefetching
- [ ] Implement write batching for performance
- [ ] Add streaming support for large memory operations
- [ ] Create memory analytics tracking (hit rates, access patterns, size metrics)
- [ ] Integrate with existing Memory.Interaction resource
- [ ] Support signal-based communication with MemoryCoordinatorAgent
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Research Summary

### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- **Jido Usage Rules**: Must use Jido.Agent with proper schema validation, tagged tuple returns, and functional patterns
- **RubberDuck BaseAgent**: Should use RubberDuck.Agents.BaseAgent for consistency with existing agents
- **Ash Framework**: Database operations must go through Ash framework only

### Documentation Reviewed
- **Jido.Agent**: OTP GenServer-based agents with state validation, lifecycle hooks, and supervision
- **Memory Domain**: Existing three-tier architecture (short/mid/long term) with Ash resources
- **Memory.Interaction**: ETS-based short-term storage with FIFO eviction (20 items per session)

### Existing Patterns Found
- **MemoryCoordinatorAgent** (/home/ducky/code/rubber_duck/lib/rubber_duck/agents/memory_coordinator_agent.ex:1): Coordinates memory operations across tiers with signal handling
- **CounterAgent** (/home/ducky/code/rubber_duck/lib/rubber_duck/jido/agents/counter_agent.ex:1): Example Jido agent with proper lifecycle callbacks and signal handling
- **Memory.Interaction** (/home/ducky/code/rubber_duck/lib/rubber_duck/memory/interaction.ex:1): ETS-based short-term memory with automatic FIFO eviction
- **BaseAgent pattern** (/home/ducky/code/rubber_duck/lib/rubber_duck/agents/base_agent.ex:1): RubberDuck-specific agent patterns with signal handling

### Technical Approach
The Short-Term Memory Agent will:

1. **Agent Architecture**: Use RubberDuck.Agents.BaseAgent as foundation with Jido.Agent patterns
2. **Storage Strategy**: 
   - Primary: ETS tables for ultra-fast in-memory access
   - Integration: Work with existing Memory.Interaction resource as backing store
   - Indexing: Multiple ETS tables for different access patterns (by_user, by_session, by_time)
3. **Memory Management**:
   - TTL-based expiration with configurable timeouts
   - LRU eviction when memory limits are reached
   - Compression using Erlang's built-in term compression
4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Read optimization with multi-level caching
   - Write batching to reduce ETS operations
   - Prefetching based on access patterns
   - Streaming for large result sets
5. **Signal Communication**:
   - Integrate with MemoryCoordinatorAgent for cross-tier operations
   - Emit signals for memory events (eviction, compression, etc.)
   - Handle coordination signals for synchronization

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Memory leaks from improper ETS cleanup | High | Implement proper supervision, TTL cleanup, and memory monitoring |
| Performance degradation under load | Medium | Use batching, compression, and efficient indexing strategies |
| Data inconsistency with Memory.Interaction | Medium | Implement proper synchronization and validation mechanisms |
| Complex state management | Medium | Use Jido Agent schema validation and lifecycle hooks |

## Log

### 2025-07-31 Implementation Progress
- Created ShortTermMemoryAgent using proper Jido.Agent pattern 
- Implemented 6 core actions: StoreMemoryAction, GetMemoryAction, SearchByUserAction, SearchBySessionAction, CleanupExpiredAction, GetAnalyticsAction, StoreWithPersistenceAction
- Code compiles successfully with minimal warnings
- Started with failing tests and working towards passing implementation
- Issue discovered: Need to fix Jido.Agent.cmd API usage - appears to be non-existent
- Next: Run simplified tests to verify basic agent functionality

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should the Short-Term Memory Agent completely replace the ETS functionality in Memory.Interaction, or work alongside it?
2. What are the preferred memory limits and TTL defaults for the short-term memory?
3. Should compression be enabled by default or opt-in for performance reasons?
4. Do you want specific telemetry events for memory operations beyond the standard Jido patterns?
