# Feature: Phoenix Channels Setup

## Overview
Implement WebSocket-based real-time communication for streaming code completions and live updates. This provides the foundation for all real-time features in the RubberDuck AI coding assistant, including streaming responses, collaborative editing, and live analysis results.

## Goals
- Enable real-time bidirectional communication between clients and server
- Support streaming of code completions and analysis results
- Implement authentication and authorization for socket connections
- Enable collaborative features with presence tracking
- Provide reliable message delivery with offline queue support

## Non-Goals
- Full collaborative editing implementation (separate feature)
- Complex UI components (handled in LiveView feature)
- Database persistence of channel messages
- Video/voice communication features

## Technical Approach
1. Configure Phoenix endpoint for WebSocket support
2. Create UserSocket module with authentication
3. Implement CodeChannel for code-related real-time features
4. Add presence tracking for collaborative features
5. Build message queuing for reliability
6. Implement rate limiting and monitoring

## Requirements
- Phoenix framework must be properly configured
- Authentication system must be in place
- WebSocket support in the deployment environment
- Client libraries for channel connections

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
1. Configure Phoenix endpoint for WebSockets
2. Create UserSocket module with basic structure
3. Set up authentication for socket connections
4. Create initial CodeChannel module

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
1. Implement channel join with project authorization
2. Add completion streaming capabilities
3. Create message handling for different event types
4. Implement basic error handling

### Phase 3: Collaborative Features
1. Add Phoenix.Presence for user tracking
2. Implement cursor position broadcasting
3. Create collaborative editing event handlers
4. Add user activity indicators

### Phase 4: Reliability & Performance
1. Implement message queuing for offline users
2. Add reconnection logic and state recovery
3. Create rate limiting for channel events
4. Add monitoring and metrics

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: WebSocket connection instability
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust reconnection logic and message queuing
- **Risk**: Performance issues with many concurrent users
  - **Mitigation**: Add rate limiting and efficient message routing
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in real-time communication
  - **Mitigation**: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks

## Success Metrics
- Successful WebSocket connections with authentication
- Messages delivered in < 100ms for local connections
- Support for 100+ concurrent channel connections
- Zero message loss with proper queuing
- Comprehensive test coverage for all channel events

## Dependencies
- Phoenix framework (already in project)
- Phoenix.PubSub for message routing
- Phoenix.Presence for user tracking
- Authentication system from previous phases

## Notes
- This is the foundation for all real-time features in Phase 5
- Consider WebSocket fallbacks for restrictive environments
- Design channel protocol to be extensible for future features
- Ensure compatibility with various client libraries
