# Feature Plan: Section 13.6 - Caching & Performance Optimization

## Overview
Enhance the existing FileCache implementation with advanced performance monitoring, distributed caching support, and comprehensive cache statistics. This builds upon the basic ETS-based cache created in section 13.5.

## Current State Analysis
We already have:
- Basic ETS-based FileCache module
- Project-based partitioning
- TTL management
- Simple invalidation system
- Integration with FileManager

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhanced Cache Statistics
**Purpose**: Track detailed cache performance metrics for optimization

**New Module**: `RubberDuck.Projects.CacheStats`
- Real-time hit/miss ratios
- Memory usage tracking
- Access frequency analysis
- Hot key detection
- Performance trends over time

**Enhancements to FileCache**:
- Add counters for hits/misses
- Track entry sizes
- Monitor access patterns
- Record operation latencies

### 2. Advanced Invalidation System
**Purpose**: Implement intelligent cache invalidation with minimal overhead

**New Features**:
- Cascading invalidation for related entries
- Pattern-based invalidation (e.g., invalidate all entries under a directory)
- Soft invalidation with background refresh
- Invalidation hooks for custom logic
- Version-based invalidation

### 3. Performance Monitoring Dashboard
**Purpose**: Provide real-time visibility into cache performance

**New Module**: `RubberDuck.Projects.CacheMonitor`
- LiveView dashboard for cache metrics
- Real-time performance graphs
- Alert configuration
- Optimization recommendations
- Historical data analysis

### 4. Memory Management & Optimization
**Purpose**: Ensure efficient memory usage and prevent cache bloat

**Features**:
- Adaptive cache sizing based on available memory
- LRU eviction when reaching memory limits
- Entry compression for large values
- Memory usage alerts
- Automatic cleanup of stale entries

### 5. Distributed Cache Foundation
**Purpose**: Prepare for multi-node deployments

**New Module**: `RubberDuck.Projects.DistributedCache`
- Cache synchronization protocol
- Node discovery via libcluster
- Consistent hashing for cache distribution
- Replication strategies
- Partition tolerance handling

### 6. Cache Warming & Preloading
**Purpose**: Improve cache effectiveness through intelligent preloading

**Features**:
- Predictive cache warming based on access patterns
- Bulk cache loading on startup
- Background cache refresh
- Priority-based warming
- Configurable warming strategies

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes
1. Extract cache statistics into separate GenServer
2. Add telemetry events for all cache operations
3. Create pluggable invalidation strategies
4. Implement cache middleware pattern

### Performance Optimizations
1. Use atomic counters for statistics
2. Implement read-through caching
3. Add write-behind caching option
4. Use binary keys for better performance
5. Implement cache key compression

### Monitoring Integration
1. Export metrics to Prometheus
2. Create Grafana dashboards
3. Add DataDog integration points
4. Implement custom telemetry reporters

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test cache statistics accuracy
- Test invalidation patterns
- Test memory management
- Test distributed cache protocols
- Test performance under load

### Integration Tests
- Test with FileManager operations
- Test multi-node scenarios
- Test cache coherency
- Test monitoring integrations

### Performance Tests
- Benchmark cache operations
- Test memory efficiency
- Test distributed performance
- Test cache warming effectiveness

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risks
1. **Memory overhead**: Statistics tracking could add significant memory usage
   - Mitigation: Use efficient data structures, configurable statistics levels

2. **Performance impact**: Monitoring could slow down cache operations
   - Mitigation: Async statistics collection, sampling strategies

3. **Distributed complexity**: Multi-node caching adds significant complexity
   - Mitigation: Start with simple replication, add complexity incrementally

4. **Cache coherency**: Ensuring consistency across nodes
   - Mitigation: Use proven algorithms, add consistency checks

## Success Criteria
1. Cache hit rate improvement of at least 20%
2. Memory usage reduction of at least 15%
3. Sub-millisecond cache operation latency
4. Zero data inconsistencies in distributed mode
5. Complete observability of cache behavior
