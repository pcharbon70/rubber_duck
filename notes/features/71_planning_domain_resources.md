# Feature 7.1: Planning Domain & Resources

## Overview
Implemented the core Planning domain based on the LLM-Modulo framework for sophisticated AI-driven planning with external validation critics.

## Implementation Date
July 18, 2025

## Components Created

### 1. Domain Module (RubberDuck.Planning)
- Main domain module that orchestrates all planning resources
- Configured with AshGraphql and AshJsonApi extensions
- Added to ash_domains configuration

### 2. Resources

#### Plan Resource
- High-level plans with context and metadata
- Attributes: name, description, type, status, context, dependencies, constraints_data, validation_results, execution_history
- Actions: create, update, transition_status, add_validation_result, record_execution
- Calculations: task_count, progress_percentage, validation_status
- Relationships: has_many tasks, constraints, validations

#### Task Resource  
- Individual tasks with dependencies and success criteria
- Attributes: name, description, complexity, status, position, success_criteria, validation_rules, execution_result
- Actions: create, update, transition_status, record_execution, add_dependency, remove_dependency
- Self-referential many-to-many relationships for dependencies
- Calculations: is_ready, dependency_count, execution_duration, complexity_score

#### TaskDependency Resource
- Join table for managing task dependencies
- Enables dependency graph analysis and topological sorting
- Unique constraint on task_id + dependency_id combination

#### Constraint Resource
- Rules and requirements for plans
- Types: dependency, resource, timing, quality, security, custom
- Enforcement levels: hard (must pass) or soft (should pass)
- Actions: create, update, toggle_active
- Calculations: validation_function, priority_score

#### Validation Resource
- Results from critic evaluations
- Tracks pass/fail status with explanations and suggestions
- Can be associated with either a plan or task
- Actions: create, update, batch_create, various list queries
- Calculations: target_type, is_blocking, impact_score

### 3. Database Structure
- Created comprehensive migrations for all tables
- Proper indexes for performance (status, type, foreign keys)
- Foreign key constraints ensuring referential integrity
- JSONB columns for flexible metadata storage

## Key Features
- Hierarchical task decomposition with dependency management
- Flexible constraint system with hard/soft enforcement
- Comprehensive validation tracking from multiple critics
- Execution history tracking for plans and tasks
- Rich calculations for progress tracking and status monitoring

## Technical Decisions
- Used Ash Resource DSL for declarative resource definitions
- Leveraged PostgreSQL JSONB for flexible schema fields
- Implemented many-to-many relationships through explicit join table
- Set require_atomic? false on actions with custom logic
- Used calculations instead of aggregates for complex derived data

## Migration Status
- All database tables created successfully
- Indexes configured for optimal query performance
- Foreign key relationships established

## Next Steps
- Add authorization policies for multi-user access control
- Write comprehensive test suite
- Implement GraphQL API endpoints
- Add real-time updates via Phoenix PubSub
- Create admin UI for plan management
