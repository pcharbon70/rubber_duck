# Feature 7.2: Task Decomposition Engine

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive task decomposition engine that breaks down high-level requests into actionable tasks using LLM-guided decomposition with validation. The engine follows the RubberDuck.Engine behavior and integrates seamlessly with the existing CoT reasoning system.

## Implementation Date
July 18, 2025

## Components Created

### 1. TaskDecomposer Engine Module
- Main engine implementing RubberDuck.Engine behavior
- Supports three decomposition strategies:
  - **Linear**: Simple sequential tasks
  - **Hierarchical**: Complex features with sub-tasks  
  - **Tree-of-Thought**: Exploratory tasks with multiple approaches
- Automatic strategy selection based on request analysis
- Comprehensive validation and refinement capabilities

### 2. Decomposition Strategies

#### Linear Decomposition
- Best for simple, sequential tasks
- Creates step-by-step task lists
- Automatic dependency linking (each depends on previous)
- Suitable for procedures and workflows

#### Hierarchical Decomposition  
- For complex features with multiple components
- Creates multi-level task structures
- Supports phases, tasks, and sub-tasks
- Integrates with CoT for structured reasoning

#### Tree-of-Thought Decomposition
- Explores multiple approaches before selecting best
- Generates 3 different decomposition strategies
- Evaluates each approach on multiple criteria
- Synthesizes best elements from all approaches

### 3. CoT Integration (DecompositionChains)
Created five specialized CoT chains:

1. **LinearDecomposition**: 4-step chain for sequential decomposition
2. **HierarchicalDecomposition**: 5-step chain for complex structures
3. **TreeOfThoughtDecomposition**: 6-step chain for exploration
4. **TaskValidation**: 5-step chain for validating decompositions
5. **RefinementChain**: 4-step chain for iterative improvement

Each chain includes:
- Structured prompts with template variables
- Step dependencies for proper flow
- Validators to ensure quality output
- Configurable timeouts and caching

### 4. Prompt Templates (DecompositionTemplates)
Comprehensive template library including:
- Strategy selection templates
- Decomposition templates for each strategy
- Complexity estimation templates
- Success criteria generation templates
- Dependency analysis templates
- Validation feedback templates
- Pattern matching templates

Templates support variable substitution and are designed for reusability.

### 5. Pattern Library
Pre-built decomposition patterns for common tasks:
- **Feature Implementation**: 4-phase pattern (Design, Implementation, Testing, Documentation)
- **Bug Fix**: 3-phase linear pattern
- **Refactoring**: 4-phase pattern with preparation
- **API Integration**: 4-phase pattern with research
- **Database Migration**: 3-phase pattern with safety checks
- **Performance Optimization**: 3-phase pattern with profiling

Each pattern includes:
- Applicable scenarios
- Task structure with complexity estimates
- Success criteria templates
- Typical dependency patterns

### 6. Key Features

#### Dependency Graph Builder
- Extracts explicit dependencies from task definitions
- Infers implicit dependencies using LLM analysis
- Detects circular dependencies with DFS algorithm
- Validates dependency consistency

#### Task Complexity Estimation
- Uses LLM to analyze task complexity
- Considers technical, domain, and coordination factors
- Maps to 5 complexity levels (trivial to very_complex)
- Validates complexity balance across decomposition

#### Success Criteria Generator
- Creates measurable success criteria for each task
- Generates acceptance tests
- Ensures criteria are SMART (Specific, Measurable, etc.)
- Links child criteria to parent task success

#### Validation System
- Validates task completeness (all required fields)
- Checks dependency consistency
- Ensures complexity balance
- Validates success criteria presence
- Provides detailed error feedback

#### Iterative Refinement
- Identifies issues in decompositions
- Proposes specific solutions
- Applies refinements systematically
- Verifies improvements

## Technical Implementation

### Engine State Management
```elixir
defstruct [
  :llm_config,
  :default_strategy,
  :max_depth,
  :min_task_size,
  :validation_enabled,
  :pattern_library
]
```

### Result Structure
```elixir
%{
  tasks: [task_maps],
  dependencies: [dependency_maps],
  strategy: atom,
  metadata: %{
    total_tasks: integer,
    max_depth: integer,
    complexity_distribution: map
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
- Uses RubberDuck.LLM.Service for AI operations
- Integrates with RubberDuck.CoT for reasoning chains
- Compatible with Planning domain resources
- Follows Engine behavior contract

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suites:
- Unit tests for engine behavior
- Tests for each decomposition strategy
- Validation logic tests
- CoT chain structure tests
- Pattern library tests
- Template functionality tests

## Usage Example
```elixir
{:ok, state} = TaskDecomposer.init(validation_enabled: true)

input = %{
  query: "Build a user authentication system",
  strategy: :hierarchical,  # optional - will auto-detect if not provided
  context: %{project: "web_app"}
}

{:ok, result} = TaskDecomposer.execute(input, state)

# Result contains decomposed tasks with dependencies
result.tasks
# => [%{"name" => "Design auth flow", "complexity" => "medium", ...}, ...]

result.dependencies  
# => [%{"from" => "task_0", "to" => "task_1", "type" => "finish_to_start"}, ...]
```

## Benefits
1. **Automated Planning**: Converts high-level requests to executable task lists
2. **Strategy Selection**: Automatically chooses best decomposition approach
3. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation ensures complete, consistent plans
4. **Reusability**: Pattern library accelerates common decompositions
5. **Flexibility**: Extensible with new strategies and patterns
6. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Planning domain

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for pattern recognition
- Historical decomposition analysis
- Team-specific pattern learning
- Real-time decomposition refinement
- Integration with project management tools
- Automated task assignment based on team skills
