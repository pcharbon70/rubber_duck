# Jido Pattern Comparison: Current vs Proper Implementation

## Current Implementation (15.1.1)

### Problems
1. **GenServer-based Agents**
   - Agents are processes, not data structures
   - Each agent consumes memory and scheduler time
   - Limited scalability

2. **Custom Signal Handling**
   ```elixir
   def handle_info({:signal, signal}, state) do
     # Custom signal processing
   end
   ```

3. **No Action System**
   - Logic embedded in handle_signal callbacks
   - Not reusable across agents
   - Difficult to test in isolation

4. **State Management**
   - State wrapped in GenServer state
   - No built-in validation
   - Custom persistence needed

## Proper Jido Implementation

### Benefits
1. **Agents as Data**
   ```elixir
   agent = %{
     id: "agent_123",
     module: ExampleAgent,
     state: %{counter: 0}
   }
   ```

2. **Actions as First-Class Citizens**
   ```elixir
   defmodule IncrementAction do
     use Jido.Action,
       name: "increment",
       schema: [amount: [type: :integer, default: 1]]
       
     def run(params, context) do
       # Reusable logic
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Signal to Action Mapping**
   - Signals trigger actions
   - Actions are queued and executed
   - Clean separation of concerns

4. **Built-in Features**
   - Schema validation
   - State persistence
   - Lifecycle callbacks
   - Error handling

## Migration Strategy

### Option 1: Gradual Migration (Recommended)
1. Keep current GenServer system
2. Add proper Jido modules alongside
3. Create adapters between systems
4. Migrate agents incrementally

### Option 2: Parallel Systems
1. Run both systems side-by-side
2. New features use proper Jido
3. Legacy features stay on GenServer
4. Eventually deprecate old system

### Option 3: Complete Rewrite
1. Stop all development
2. Rewrite everything to proper Jido
3. High risk, high reward
4. Not recommended for production

## Code Examples

### Current Pattern (GenServer)
```elixir
defmodule MyAgent do
  use RubberDuck.Jido.BaseAgent
  
  def init(config) do
    {:ok, %{counter: 0}}
  end
  
  def handle_signal(%{type: "increment"}, state) do
    {:ok, %{state | counter: state.counter + 1}}
  end
end

# Start as process
{:ok, pid} = MyAgent.start_link(%{})
```

### Proper Jido Pattern
```elixir
defmodule MyAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    schema: [counter: [type: :integer, default: 0]],
    actions: [IncrementAction]
end

# Create as data
{:ok, agent} = Core.create_agent(MyAgent)

# Execute action
{:ok, result, agent} = Core.execute_action(agent, IncrementAction, %{amount: 1})
```

## Performance Implications

### Current Implementation
- Memory: ~25KB per agent process
- CPU: Scheduler overhead for each agent
- Limit: ~10K agents per node

### Proper Jido
- Memory: ~1KB per agent (data only)
- CPU: Shared worker pool
- Limit: ~100K+ agents per node

## Recommendations

1. **For New Features**: Use proper Jido patterns
2. **For Existing Code**: Keep as-is, migrate gradually
3. **For Critical Path**: Extensive testing before migration
4. **For Documentation**: Update to show both patterns

## Timeline Estimate

- Research & Planning: 1 week
- Adapter Implementation: 2 weeks
- First Agent Migration: 1 week
- Full Migration: 2-3 months
- Testing & Validation: Ongoing

## Conclusion

While the current implementation works, it doesn't leverage Jido's true power. The proper implementation would provide better scalability, maintainability, and alignment with Jido's design philosophy. However, a gradual migration approach minimizes risk while providing a path forward.
