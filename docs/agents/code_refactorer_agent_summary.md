# CodeRefactorerAgent Implementation Summary

## Overview
The CodeRefactorerAgent has been successfully implemented as part of the tool agents migration to the CloudEvents-compliant signal system. This agent orchestrates the CodeRefactorer tool to provide intelligent code transformation workflows with pattern management, quality tracking, and validation capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Pattern-Based Refactoring
- Pre-defined patterns for common code improvements
- Custom pattern creation and management
- Pattern effectiveness tracking with usage statistics
- Priority-based pattern suggestions (high, medium, low)

### 2. Intelligent Code Analysis
- Automatic detection of refactoring opportunities
- Complexity-based suggestions
- Code smell identification (magic numbers, complex conditionals, poor error handling)
- Threshold-based filtering for suggestions

### 3. Batch Processing
- Multiple file refactoring in single operations
- Progress tracking for long-running transformations
- Consolidated results reporting
- Maintains consistency across related files

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Auto-validation of refactored code
- Syntax checking and AST validation
- Complexity comparison (before/after)
- Functionality preservation checks
- Configurable validation rules

### 5. Metrics and Tracking
- Complexity reduction measurements
- Per-file quality improvement history
- Refactoring type statistics
- Common issue identification and tracking

## Signal Interface

### Input Signals
- `refactor_code` - Core refactoring with instructions
- `batch_refactor` - Multiple file transformation
- `suggest_refactorings` - Automated improvement detection
- `apply_pattern` - Use saved refactoring patterns
- `validate_refactoring` - Validate proposed changes
- `save_refactoring_pattern` - Store custom patterns

### Output Signals (CloudEvents Format)
- `code.refactored` - Transformation complete with results
- `code.refactoring.progress` - Real-time status updates
- `code.refactoring.suggested` - Improvement recommendations
- `code.refactoring.batch.started/completed` - Batch lifecycle
- `code.refactoring.validated` - Validation results
- `code.refactoring.pattern.saved` - Pattern stored
- `code.refactoring.error` - Error notifications

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```elixir
schema: [
  # Preferences
  default_refactoring_type: "general",
  default_style_guide: "credo",
  preserve_comments_by_default: true,
  
  # Pattern library
  refactoring_patterns: %{
    "extract_constants" => %{
      instruction: "Extract magic numbers and strings into named constants",
      type: "extract_function",
      priority: :high
    },
    "simplify_conditionals" => %{
      instruction: "Simplify complex conditional logic using pattern matching",
      type: "pattern_matching",
      priority: :medium
    },
    "improve_error_handling" => %{
      instruction: "Use proper {:ok, result} and {:error, reason} tuples",
      type: "error_handling",
      priority: :high
    }
  },
  
  # Operations tracking
  batch_refactorings: %{},
  refactoring_history: [],
  quality_improvements: %{},
  
  # Validation
  auto_validate: true,
  validation_rules: %{
    "preserve_functionality" => true,
    "maintain_tests" => true,
    "check_complexity" => true
  },
  
  # Statistics
  refactoring_stats: %{
    total_refactored: 0,
    by_type: %{},
    improvements_made: %{},
    average_complexity_reduction: 0,
    most_common_issues: %{}
  }
]
```

### Refactoring Types Supported
1. **general** - Generic improvements
2. **extract_function** - Function extraction
3. **inline_function** - Function inlining
4. **rename** - Variable/function renaming
5. **simplify** - Logic simplification
6. **restructure** - Code restructuring
7. **performance** - Performance optimizations
8. **readability** - Readability improvements
9. **pattern_matching** - Convert to pattern matching
10. **error_handling** - Improve error handling

### Complexity Calculation
The agent uses a simple but effective complexity metric:
- Control structures (if, case, cond, with, try, rescue, catch)
- Function count
- Anonymous function usage
- Overall code structure

### Pattern Detection Logic
```elixir
- extract_function: Long functions (>100 chars) with do/end blocks
- pattern_matching: Code containing if/case statements
- error_handling: Missing {:ok/:error} tuples or using raise/throw
- simplify: Complexity score > 10
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Refactoring
```elixir
signal = %{
  "type" => "refactor_code",
  "data" => %{
    "code" => "def calc(x), do: x * 42",
    "instruction" => "Extract magic number to constant"
  }
}
```

### Batch Refactoring
```elixir
signal = %{
  "type" => "batch_refactor",
  "data" => %{
    "instruction" => "Add proper error handling",
    "files" => [
      %{"code" => "...", "path" => "lib/module1.ex"},
      %{"code" => "...", "path" => "lib/module2.ex"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Pattern Application
```elixir
signal = %{
  "type" => "apply_pattern",
  "data" => %{
    "pattern_name" => "improve_error_handling",
    "code" => "def divide(a, b), do: a / b"
  }
}
```

### Automated Suggestions
```elixir
signal = %{
  "type" => "suggest_refactorings",
  "data" => %{
    "code" => "complex nested if statements...",
    "threshold" => "medium"
  }
}
```

## Quality Tracking

### Per-File Improvements
The agent tracks quality improvements for each file:
- Complexity reduction percentage
- Refactoring types applied
- Timestamp of changes
- Cumulative improvement score

### Statistical Analysis
- Total refactorings performed
- Distribution by refactoring type
- Average complexity reduction
- Most common code issues identified
- Pattern effectiveness metrics

## Testing Coverage
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Basic refactoring with various parameters
- Batch processing workflows
- Pattern management and application
- Automated suggestion generation
- Validation logic
- History and statistics tracking
- Error handling scenarios

## Future Enhancements
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Learn from successful refactorings
2. **Custom Validation Rules**: User-defined validation criteria
3. **Incremental Refactoring**: Step-by-step transformations
4. **Cross-File Refactoring**: Handle module-wide changes
5. **Refactoring Rollback**: Undo capability with history
6. **IDE Integration**: Direct integration with development environments

## Migration Notes
This agent was built from the ground up with the CloudEvents-compliant signal system:
- All signals use `Jido.Signal.new!(%{type: "domain.event", source: "agent:id", data: %{}})`
- Follows CloudEvents 1.0.2 specification
- Compatible with the Jido.Signal.Bus infrastructure

## Best Practices
1. **Always validate** critical refactorings using auto_validate
2. **Use patterns** for consistency across the codebase
3. **Track metrics** to measure code quality improvements
4. **Batch similar** refactorings for efficiency
5. **Review suggestions** before applying automated changes
