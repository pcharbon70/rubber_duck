# Feature 13.3: Multi-Project Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive project watcher management system that efficiently handles multiple concurrent file watchers with resource pooling, activity tracking, and automatic cleanup.

## Components Implemented

### 1. WatcherManager GenServer (`/lib/rubber_duck/projects/watcher_manager.ex`)
- Centralized management of all file watchers
- Resource pooling with configurable limits (default: 20 watchers)
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction strategy
- Request queueing when at capacity
- Activity tracking and telemetry events

Key features:
- **Start/Stop Watchers**: `start_watcher/2`, `stop_watcher/1`
- **Activity Tracking**: `touch_activity/1` called automatically on file events
- **Statistics**: `get_stats/0` returns active watchers, queue length, eviction counts
- **Monitoring**: `list_watchers/0` returns all active watchers sorted by activity

### 2. FileWatcher Integration
Updated FileWatcher to automatically notify WatcherManager of activity:
```elixir
# In flush_event_buffer/1
if Code.ensure_loaded?(RubberDuck.Projects.WatcherManager) do
  RubberDuck.Projects.WatcherManager.touch_activity(state.project_id)
end
```

### 3. Application Supervision
Added WatcherManager to the application supervision tree after FileWatcher.Supervisor.

## Resource Management

### Limits and Eviction
- Maximum concurrent watchers: 20 (configurable)
- LRU eviction for watchers older than 5 minutes
- High-priority watchers avoid eviction
- Queue timeout: 5 seconds (configurable)

### Cleanup Process
- Periodic cleanup every 5 minutes
- Removes watchers inactive for 30+ minutes
- Graceful termination with event logging
- Automatic queue processing after cleanup

## Telemetry Events
The system emits the following telemetry events:
- `[:rubber_duck, :watcher_manager, :watcher_started]`
- `[:rubber_duck, :watcher_manager, :watcher_stopped]`
- `[:rubber_duck, :watcher_manager, :watcher_evicted]`
- `[:rubber_duck, :watcher_manager, :cleanup_completed]`
- `[:rubber_duck, :watcher_manager, :queue_timeout]`
- `[:rubber_duck, :watcher_manager, :request_queued]`

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Basic start/stop operations
- Resource limit enforcement
- LRU eviction behavior
- Queue management
- Activity tracking
- Cleanup processes
- Telemetry event emission

## Configuration
Default configuration can be overridden via application config:
```elixir
config :rubber_duck, RubberDuck.Projects.WatcherManager,
  max_watchers: 20,
  inactive_timeout_minutes: 30,
  cleanup_interval_minutes: 5,
  queue_timeout_ms: 5000
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Watcher
```elixir
{:ok, :started} = WatcherManager.start_watcher("project_123", %{
  root_path: "/path/to/project",
  priority: :high
})
```

### Getting Statistics
```elixir
stats = WatcherManager.get_stats()
# => %{
#      active_watchers: 15,
#      queued_requests: 2,
#      total_started: 237,
#      total_evicted: 89,
#      uptime_seconds: 3600,
#      max_watchers: 20
#    }
```

### Listing Active Watchers
```elixir
watchers = WatcherManager.list_watchers()
# Returns list of WatcherInfo structs sorted by last activity
```

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Queue Management
Initial implementation had issues with proper GenServer reply handling for queued requests. Fixed by:
- Separating queue_request logic to return state only
- Handling replies in the caller
- Proper cleanup of timer references

### 2. Race Conditions
Handled cases where watchers might be started multiple times:
- Check for already_started errors
- Monitor watcher processes for crashes
- Automatic cleanup on process death

### 3. Testing Constraints
Tests needed to work with a globally started WatcherManager:
- Adapted tests to use unique project IDs
- Tested behavior rather than exact configurations
- Used statistics to verify operations

## Performance Considerations
- O(1) watcher lookup by project ID using Map storage
- O(n) LRU eviction (could be optimized with priority queue)
- Efficient queue operations using Erlang's :queue module
- Minimal overhead for activity tracking

## Future Enhancements
1. Distributed watcher management across nodes
2. Persistent activity history
3. Machine learning for usage prediction
4. Dynamic limit adjustment based on system resources
5. WebSocket notifications for watcher events

## Conclusion
The Multi-Project Management System successfully provides efficient resource management for file watchers, preventing resource exhaustion while maintaining optimal performance for active projects. The implementation includes comprehensive monitoring, automatic cleanup, and graceful degradation under load.
