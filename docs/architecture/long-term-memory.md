# Long-Term Memory Agent Architecture

## Overview

The Long-Term Memory Agent provides persistent, searchable storage for long-term memory data across the RubberDuck system. It manages historical context, learned patterns, and accumulated knowledge with efficient indexing, versioning, and retrieval capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. LongTermMemoryAgent

The main agent module that handles all memory operations:

- **State Management**: Maintains indices, cache, pending writes, and metrics
- **Signal Processing**: Handles storage, retrieval, and management operations
- **Background Tasks**: Manages periodic flushes, index updates, and optimization

### 2. Data Structures

#### MemoryEntry
- Core data structure representing a single memory
- Supports compression, encryption, and versioning
- Tracks access patterns and relationships
- Provides TTL-based expiration

#### MemoryIndex
- Manages different index types (fulltext, metadata, vector)
- Provides efficient search capabilities
- Supports index optimization and maintenance
- Tracks query performance metrics

#### MemoryVersion
- Tracks changes over time
- Supports diff generation and rollback
- Enables audit trails
- Allows version merging

#### MemoryQuery
- Fluent API for building complex queries
- Supports filtering, sorting, and aggregation
- Provides pagination and cursor support
- Enables query optimization

## Storage Architecture

### Write Path
1. Memory creation/update requests arrive via signals
2. Memories are added to write buffer
3. Buffer flushes when full or on schedule
4. Batch writes to storage backend
5. Indices updated asynchronously

### Read Path
1. Query requests check cache first
2. Cache misses query storage backend
3. Results added to cache with LRU eviction
4. Access patterns tracked for optimization

### Indexing System
- **Full-text Index**: Token-based search with posting lists
- **Metadata Index**: Field-based filtering and faceting
- **Vector Index**: Similarity search (future)
- **Composite Index**: Combined index types

## Memory Types

Supported memory types:
- `user_profile`: User preferences and settings
- `code_pattern`: Recognized code patterns
- `interaction`: Historical interactions
- `knowledge`: Domain knowledge entries
- `optimization`: Performance optimizations
- `configuration`: System configurations

## Signal Interface

### Storage Operations
- `store_memory`: Create new memory entry
- `update_memory`: Update existing memory
- `delete_memory`: Soft/hard delete memory
- `bulk_store`: Batch memory creation

### Retrieval Operations
- `search_memories`: Full-text search
- `query_memories`: Complex queries
- `get_memory`: Retrieve by ID
- `get_related`: Find related memories

### Management Operations
- `optimize_storage`: Run optimization
- `reindex_memory`: Update indices
- `get_memory_stats`: Get statistics
- `get_memory_versions`: Version history

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- LRU cache with configurable size
- Frequently accessed memories prioritized
- Cache warming on startup
- Hit rate tracking

### Write Buffering
- Configurable buffer size
- Batch writes for efficiency
- Automatic flush on schedule
- Priority flush for bulk operations

### Index Optimization
- Periodic index rebuilding
- Fragmentation detection
- Query-based optimization
- Background maintenance

### Compression
- Automatic for large memories
- Zlib compression
- Size threshold configurable
- Transparent decompression

## Versioning System

### Change Tracking
- Every update creates version
- Diff-based storage
- Configurable version retention
- Merge capability

### Rollback Support
- Point-in-time recovery
- Version compatibility checking
- Conflict resolution
- Audit trail maintenance

## Integration Points

### With Memory Coordinator
- Receives persistence requests
- Provides retrieval services
- Coordinates lifecycle
- Manages garbage collection

### With Short-Term Memory
- Receives memory promotion
- Provides historical context
- Manages memory transfer

### With Context Builder
- Supplies relevant history
- Provides learned patterns
- Delivers user preferences

### With RAG Pipeline
- Provides searchable knowledge
- Supplies embeddings
- Delivers ranked results

## Configuration

Key configuration options:
```elixir
%{
  cache_size: 1000,              # Maximum cache entries
  write_buffer_size: 100,        # Buffer before flush
  compression_enabled: true,      # Enable compression
  encryption_enabled: false,      # Enable encryption
  flush_interval: 10_000,        # Buffer flush interval (ms)
  index_update_interval: 30_000, # Index update interval (ms)
  ttl_check_interval: 3_600_000, # TTL check interval (ms)
  storage_backend: :postgresql   # Storage backend type
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Cache continues on storage failure
- Partial index availability
- Query timeout handling
- Automatic retry logic

### Recovery Procedures
- Write buffer persistence
- Index rebuild capability
- Version recovery
- Backup restoration

## Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- Total memories stored
- Storage size (bytes)
- Index size (bytes)
- Query count and performance
- Cache hit rate
- Write throughput

### Health Checks
- Storage connectivity
- Index integrity
- Cache performance
- Memory growth rate

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Memory-level permissions
- Query result filtering
- User data isolation
- Admin operations

### Data Protection
- Optional encryption at rest
- Secure deletion
- Audit logging
- Compliance support

## Future Enhancements

1. **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity using embeddings
2. **Distributed Storage**: Multi-node support
3. **ML-based Optimization**: Query and storage optimization
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Usage pattern analysis
5. **Auto-categorization**: ML-based classification
