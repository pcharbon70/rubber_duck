# RubberDuck AI Coding Assistant: System Design Overview

## Architecture patterns power Elixir's AI coding revolution

Building an AI-powered coding assistant in Elixir leverages the platform's unique strengths in concurrency, fault tolerance, and functional programming. The combination of Ash Framework's declarative data modeling, Spark DSL's extensible meta-programming capabilities, and Elixir's OTP patterns creates a robust foundation for intelligent code assistance that can scale to thousands of concurrent users while maintaining reliability and performance.

## Core architecture embraces actor-model concurrency

The RubberDuck system would be built on Elixir's actor-model architecture, where each component runs as an isolated process communicating through message passing. This design ensures fault tolerance - if one component fails, others continue operating unaffected.

**Application Supervisor Structure**: The root supervisor manages three primary subsystems: the AI processing pipeline, user session management, and plugin infrastructure. Each subsystem has its own supervision tree, following the one-for-one strategy where individual process failures don't cascade.

**Process Architecture**: User sessions are managed by individual GenServer processes, registered via Elixir's Registry for efficient lookup. Each session maintains conversation context, project information, and user preferences in isolated state. The AI processing pipeline uses GenStage for backpressure management, ensuring the system gracefully handles load spikes without overwhelming LLM providers.

**Concurrent Request Handling**: Multiple user requests process simultaneously through Task.async patterns, with each LLM call executing in its own supervised process. This isolation prevents slow or failed API calls from blocking other users.

## Ash Framework models the domain declaratively

The data layer uses **Ash Framework** to define resources declaratively, automatically deriving APIs, validations, and authorization rules from the domain model.

**Core Resources**: The system defines resources for Users, Projects, Conversations, Messages, CodeFiles, and CodeSuggestions. Each resource encapsulates attributes, actions, relationships, and policies. For example, a Conversation resource includes attributes for context type (code review, bug fix, feature request), relationships to users and projects, and actions for message handling.

**Action-Centered Design**: Rather than exposing raw CRUD operations, Ash actions represent meaningful business operations. A CodeFile resource might have actions like `analyze_code`, `apply_suggestion`, and `generate_tests`, each with specific validation rules and side effects.

**Authorization System**: Ash's policy framework provides field-level security, ensuring users only access their own projects and conversations. Policies use actor-based authorization, where all actions are performed by an identified actor with specific permissions.

## Spark DSL enables plugin extensibility

**Spark DSL** serves as the meta-DSL engine powering Ash and enabling the plugin system. It provides compile-time transformations, validations, and code generation from DSL definitions.

**Plugin Definition DSL**: Plugins define their capabilities using Spark DSL, specifying supported commands, required permissions, and integration points. The DSL compiles to efficient Elixir code with full type checking and documentation.

**Extension Points**: The system exposes extension points for code analysis, generation, refactoring, and documentation. Each extension point has a defined interface using Elixir behaviors, ensuring plugins implement required callbacks.

**Hot Code Loading**: Spark's compilation model works with Elixir's hot code swapping, allowing plugins to be updated without system restart. The plugin supervisor manages lifecycle events, gracefully upgrading running plugin instances.

## Conversation engine system powers intelligent interactions

The conversation system uses specialized engines to handle different types of queries efficiently.

**Engine Types**: Seven specialized conversation engines handle different interaction patterns:
- **SimpleConversation**: Direct responses to straightforward queries without complex reasoning
- **ComplexConversation**: Multi-step reasoning using Chain-of-Thought for intricate problems
- **AnalysisConversation**: Code review and architecture analysis with detailed recommendations
- **GenerationConversation**: Code generation with implementation planning and scaffolding
- **ProblemSolver**: Debugging assistance with root cause analysis
- **MultiStepConversation**: Context-aware conversations maintaining state across exchanges
- **ConversationRouter**: Intelligent routing based on query classification

**LLM Integration**: The LLM Service manages provider connections, rate limiting, and failover, while conversation engines handle the AI logic. This separation ensures clean architecture where the LLM Service focuses purely on provider management without embedded business logic.

## Enhancement techniques improve response quality

The conversation engines implement several enhancement techniques to improve response quality and reliability.

**Chain of Thought Prompting**: Complex queries route to engines that use CoT prompting, breaking down problems into steps: requirement analysis, architecture planning, implementation, testing, and review. Each step feeds into the next, building comprehensive solutions.

**Retrieval Augmented Generation**: A RAG pipeline indexes project codebases using tree-sitter for parsing and Bumblebee for embeddings. When generating code, the system retrieves relevant context from existing files, ensuring consistency with project patterns.

**Self-Correction Loop**: Generated code undergoes iterative refinement through a self-correction pipeline. The system analyzes output for syntax errors, style violations, and logical issues, then prompts for corrections.

**Memory Management**: Conversation context uses a sliding window approach, maintaining recent messages while summarizing older interactions. This balances context relevance with token limits.

## Data flow orchestrates intelligent assistance

Understanding how data flows through the system reveals the coordination between components.

**Request Flow**: User input arrives via Phoenix Channels (WebSocket), creating conversation messages through the ConversationChannel. The channel routes requests to the EngineManager, which delegates to specialized conversation engines based on query type.

**Context Assembly**: The conversation engines assemble context by accessing conversation history, retrieving relevant code files through the memory system, and gathering project metadata. The ConversationRouter intelligently selects the appropriate engine (SimpleConversation, ComplexConversation, AnalysisConversation, etc.) based on query classification.

**Response Generation**: The selected engine processes the request, potentially using Chain-of-Thought reasoning for complex queries. Responses stream back through Phoenix Channels, updating the UI in real-time. The engine system ensures proper routing to LLM providers while maintaining conversation context.

**Feedback Loop**: Each conversation maintains context across messages, allowing for multi-turn interactions. The conversation engines track user preferences and conversation history to provide contextually relevant responses.

## Plugin architecture ensures extensibility

The plugin system uses Elixir behaviors and protocols to define extension interfaces while maintaining security and isolation.

**Plugin Isolation**: Each plugin runs in a supervised process with resource limits. A sandbox environment restricts filesystem access and external calls, preventing malicious code execution.

**Event-Driven Integration**: Plugins subscribe to system events like file changes, conversation updates, or code analysis completion. The EventBus manages subscriptions and ensures ordered delivery.

**Hook System**: Strategic hook points allow plugins to modify behavior at key stages: pre-processing user input, post-processing LLM responses, and augmenting code analysis results.

**Dynamic Discovery**: The plugin registry scans designated directories, validating and loading plugins that implement required behaviors. A capability negotiation protocol ensures version compatibility.

## Concurrent processing maximizes performance

Elixir's concurrency model enables efficient handling of multiple simultaneous operations without blocking.

**Parallel Analysis**: When analyzing a codebase, the system spawns parallel processes for each file, aggregating results through a coordinator process. This approach scales linearly with available CPU cores.

**Stream Processing**: Large codebases process as streams, avoiding memory overhead. File analysis results flow through the pipeline as they complete, enabling progressive UI updates.

**Circuit Breakers**: External service calls use circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures. If an LLM provider experiences issues, the circuit opens, returning cached responses or falling back to alternative providers.

**Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithms manage API rate limits per user and globally. The system gracefully queues requests when approaching limits, ensuring fair resource allocation.

## Fault tolerance ensures reliability

The system's fault tolerance mechanisms guarantee continued operation despite component failures.

**Supervision Strategy**: Each major component has its own supervisor, isolating failures. The AI processor supervisor restarts failed analysis tasks, while the session supervisor preserves user state across restarts.

**Process Monitoring**: Health checks monitor critical processes, triggering alerts for anomalous behavior. Memory usage, message queue depth, and response times are continuously tracked.

**Graceful Degradation**: When optional components fail, the system continues with reduced functionality. Plugin failures disable specific features without affecting core operations.

**Error Recovery**: Transient errors trigger exponential backoff retries. Persistent failures escalate to administrators while providing users with meaningful error messages.

## Implementation showcases Elixir's strengths

The RubberDuck architecture demonstrates why Elixir excels for AI-powered applications. The functional programming paradigm makes code easier for LLMs to understand and generate. Built-in concurrency handles thousands of simultaneous users without complex threading. Hot code reloading enables continuous deployment without downtime. Most importantly, the supervisor hierarchy ensures system resilience - a critical requirement for production AI services.

The combination of Ash Framework's declarative modeling, Spark DSL's extensibility, and Elixir's OTP patterns creates a system that's both powerful and maintainable. As AI capabilities evolve, the architecture's plugin system and hot code swapping allow seamless integration of new features. The result is an AI coding assistant that's not just intelligent, but also reliable, scalable, and extensible - embodying the best practices of modern Elixir development.
