RubberDuck is an Elixir-based AI coding assistant system built with the Ash Framework. The project aims to create a sophisticated, pluggable platform integrating modern LLM techniques with Elixir's strengths in concurrency, fault tolerance, and real-time communication.

## Overview

RubberDuck leverages the power of the Ash Framework to provide a declarative, extensible foundation for building AI-powered coding assistance features. The system is designed to be:

- **Pluggable**: Modular architecture allowing easy extension and customization
- **Concurrent**: Built on Elixir/OTP for robust concurrent processing
- **Fault-tolerant**: Leveraging OTP supervision trees for resilient operation
- **Real-time**: Supporting live, interactive coding assistance

## Technology Stack

- **Elixir**: Core programming language
- **Ash Framework**: Declarative application framework
- **Phoenix**: Web framework integration (via ash_phoenix)
- **OTP**: For concurrency and fault tolerance

## Implementation Plan

For detailed implementation plans and architecture decisions, see the [Implementation Plan](planning/implementation_plan.md).

## Getting Started

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Create and setup database (requires PostgreSQL 16+)
mix ash.setup

# Install git hooks (recommended)
./.githooks/install.sh

# Run tests
mix test

# Start the application
mix phx.server
```

## Configuration

### Timeout Configuration

RubberDuck provides a comprehensive timeout configuration system that allows tuning timeouts across all components. See the [Timeout Configuration Guide](docs/configuration/timeouts.md) for details.

Key features:
- Centralized configuration in `config/timeouts.exs`
- Runtime overrides via environment variables
- Dynamic timeout adjustment based on context
- Support for JSON-based configuration overrides

Quick example:
```bash
# Override specific timeouts
export RUBBER_DUCK_CHANNEL_TIMEOUT=120000  # 2 minutes
export RUBBER_DUCK_LLM_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=60000  # 1 minute

# Or use JSON for complex overrides
export RUBBER_DUCK_TIMEOUTS_JSON='{"channels": {"conversation": 120000}}'
```

## Development

This project follows specific conventions and rules documented in `CLAUDE.md`. Key principles include:

- Declarative design using Ash Framework patterns
- Proper OTP supervision and fault tolerance
- Idiomatic Elixir code following community standards
- Comprehensive testing and documentation
