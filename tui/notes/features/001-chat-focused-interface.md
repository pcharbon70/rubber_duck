# Feature: Chat-Focused TUI Interface

## Summary
Transform the TUI from a traditional three-pane layout (file tree + editor + output) into a chat-focused interface where chat is the primary view and file tree/editor are optional toggleable panels.

## Requirements
- [x] Create scrollable chat interface with message history
- [x] Support user input at bottom of chat with multi-line capability
- [x] Display different message types (user, assistant, system) with distinct formatting
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts to toggle file tree visibility (Ctrl+F)
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts to toggle editor visibility (Ctrl+E)
- [x] Implement dynamic layout that adjusts based on visible panels
- [x] Integrate chat messages with unified command system
- [x] Support streaming responses from server
- [x] Maintain existing functionality when panels are shown
- [x] Update help documentation with new shortcuts

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All core requirements have been implemented.

   - Scrollable message history using viewport
   - Multi-line input with textarea
   - Message type support (user, assistant, system, error)

2. **Dynamic Layout** (`internal/ui/view.go`):

   - `Tab`: Cycle through visible panes
   - `Enter`: Send message
   - `Ctrl+Enter`: Newline in chat

4. **Command Integration**:
   - Messages starting with `/` parsed as commands
   - Regular messages sent as chat commands
   - Integration with existing command router
   - Echo functionality for testing

5. **Panel Management**:
   - File tree and editor are optional
   - Status bar shows active panels
   - Smooth transitions between layouts
