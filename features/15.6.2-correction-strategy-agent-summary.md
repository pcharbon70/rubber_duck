- **Pareto Optimization**: Finds optimal solutions across multiple objectives
- **Machine Learning**: Applies learned patterns for strategy recommendations
- **A/B Testing**: Continuous testing and optimization of strategy choices

### Comprehensive Cost Estimation
- **Time Costs**: Processing time, LLM usage costs
- **Resource Costs**: CPU, memory, human interaction costs
- **Risk Costs**: Potential for additional errors, rollback difficulty
- **Learning Integration**: Historical accuracy adjustments

### Advanced Learning System
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies success/failure patterns, cost trends, temporal patterns
- **Feedback Processing**: Tracks outcomes and updates models
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjusts to environmental changes and performance feedback
- **Prediction Capabilities**: Estimates strategy performance based on historical similarity

### Robust Validation Framework
- **Prerequisites Checking**: Validates required conditions before strategy application

- **Reliable**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Next Steps

The Correction Strategy Agent is now ready for integration with the broader error correction workflow. It can:
1. Receive error detection signals from the Error Detection Agent
2. Provide intelligent strategy recommendations
3. Learn from correction outcomes
4. Optimize strategy selection over time

This completes the implementation of section 15.6.2 from the Jido refactoring plan.
